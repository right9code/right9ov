Imagine...
You take your first few steps into the bar. People stop what they are doing to look and wonder who you are. As you walk, women are looking you over, adjusting their hair and making sure you see them, guys are getting out of your way and you see the body language of the whole room begin to shift towards you. "Is he a celebrity or something?", you hear from across the bar. As a woman that would make most guys fall to their knees walks behind you, you grab her arm and she takes in a deep breath of excitement that she is able to talk to you. After two minutes, she's bringing her friends to meet you, buying you drinks and touching you every time she laughs. Within ten minutes, you are kissing her. You tell her things are moving to fast and you'll come find her later. As you say goodbyes, you walk straight up to the next group of women and repeat the exact same process. It's like this every...single...night.

This book is the no-fluff reference guide for men.

The simple five-step process you can use tonight:
All first-time sexual experiences will revolve around the same basic steps:

REMEMBER: F.A.I.R.S.
Focus - Grab attention and hold it
Attract -Build attraction by having highstatus
Interact - use humor and stories to get her going
Resist - play the 'we're moving too fast' game
Seduce - advance, advance, resist, repeat

# INTRODUCTION 

It is my dream that this book will eventually be worn out from overuse. The cover faded and torn, the pages dog-eared and scribbled on, and your own notes and experiences lining the margins. It should be held together by a rubber band by the time it's discarded. It should be studied, re-read often, and handed down to younger and less experienced guys. It should be the legacy and the legend that will circulate from hand to hand, changing the lives of men. This book is all that is needed to understand, master, and control the dating scene.

My six promises to you:

1. You will understand women better than most women know themselves.
2. You will be able to quickly build and maintain sexual attraction.
3. You will be more dominant and in

---

control in your personal and professional life.
4. You will have more choice with women...from this day forward.
5. Every time you read this book, it will mean something different because you will have learned more about women with each experience.
6. This book contains zero fluff.

People will spend countless amounts of time, money, and effort studying techniques and methods for all aspects of their lives, but when it comes to women and dating, things are left to chance. By holding this book, you are now one in ten thousand men who will have the power every man wants with women.

On the fundamental level, only two things are needed to attract the women of your dreams: social status and the reversal of traditional chase-and-pursue roles. You WILL have higher status than her, and she WILL chase you.

There are more women than men in this world...it's time to start acting like it.

Prepare for launch...

# INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING 

Meet Bob. Bob likes women. He would eventually like to have an awesome relationship with a gorgeous, intelligent, mature, and caring woman. He sees women every day that he would like to date, but does nothing about it. He might stand near them, say "Hi," or compliment them on occasion, but nothing ever happens for him. When he went on dates in the past, he tried everything he read about in the dating books and men's magazine columns: buying flowers, gifts, dinners, lots of compliments, asking questions about her all night long to keep the conversation going. He tried to show them how successful and cool he is by talking about his life, his job, and his desires. Women walk all over him,tell him they would be better off as friends, and basically just don't feel that strong sense of attraction to him.

His friends and family tell him that the right one will come along soon. That he just has to be "himself" and it will happen naturally...but nothing happens. He sees ugly-looking guys with some of the most gorgeous women he's ever seen and he resents them for it. It's causing problems at work and it's making him start to wonder what the hell those guys have that he doesn't.

Now meet Dan. Dan considers himself a true ladies' man. He goes out to bars and clubs, grabs women's asses, buys lots of drinks for them, brags about his job and what kind of car he drives, and thinks he's god's gift to women. When none of them go home with him, he simply excuses it by telling himself they are "sluts" or they don't deserve him anyway. Dan gets "lucky" once in a while, but that's all it is...LUCK. Dan returns alone, 300 dollars later, to his apartment.

Finally, here's Bruce: proud owner of The Passport. He wakes up every day with a sense of excitement to be alive. He has his life in order and he knows what he wants

---

from women. As Bruce goes to the gym, his office, the grocery store, and back to his house, he knows women are interested in him. Everywhere he goes, girls check him out, ask him how he is doing, and try to look sexy when he walks past them. It takes virtually NO effort for Bruce to get the response from women that most men dream of. He is NOT a good-looking guy...he just knows himself, and he knows women.

# MISSION GOALS 

Guys come to me and tell me they might never get a chance to be able to choose women rather than be chosen by women. Maybe because they think they are fat, bald, short, tall, ugly, too nice, have bad teeth, or whatever. Nothing could be further from the truth. When those guys are able to kiss the most beautiful and perfect woman they've ever seen after five minutes of conversation with them, they change their mind quickly. Looks, as you will soon find out, don't matter.

Having power and choice with women begins and ends with you, not her. Most men, because they are visually aroused and attracted to women, think that women will naturally be the same way. While this is mildly true for the first few seconds of interaction, emotions are what control women's behavior and attraction, not looks. That's why women buy romance novels, and men buy porn.

When a woman gets approached five times a day for so many years, there's an automatic "bitch" reaction that she puts up to deal with guys. Can you imagine if she dated every single guy who approached her? She would be pretty busy. What will you do to show her you're different? What makes you the exception?

When you use the Passport, she will immediately realize she's dealing with a man on a whole different level than anyone she's ever encountered. You will be able to immediately establish attraction, build lust, and make her want to be with you. Think it can't be done? Think again. Anyone can do it as long as they are committed to the change. This book will not change you; it can only show you the door that you need to walk through. Simply reading the words will improve your success with women, but the exercises, techniques, and methods are here for you to use. Use them. That is what will make a drastic change in your success.To master women and dating, you need to commit to spending some time and effort on making yourself better. Use the transformation process; it has worked for many, many men, and it can work for you. The failures, successes, and triumphs of over a hundred men for six years are in these pages. This book was designed and written to be the end-all of seduction, dating, and relationship books. You won't ever need anything else. Let's start with a few very simple explanations of who women really are.

## FEMALE PSYCHOLOGY (DEBUNKED)

Everything Mom told you is wrong...though I'm sure she meant well. Most women don't even know what I'm about to tell you.

Women have the ability to feel other's emotions, read body language like an FBI interrogator, and keep a complete sense of awareness that would make most men green with envy. A woman can predict what their mate will say sometimes before their mate even begins to think about saying it. Even female infants can read facial expressions and hear emotions in their parents' voices better than male infants. The female brain is incredibly more

---

socially advanced and emotionally sensitive than a man's, and it's been this way since the beginning of our time.

A beautiful woman, on average, will be approached, asked out, whistled at, stared at, asked stupid questions, offered lame pickup lines, winked at, grabbed, said hello to, and just plain asked for her number about four thousand times before you come along. She is also probably used to having lots of power when it comes to men. Women can get average guys to do all kinds of stupid, degrading, and ridiculous things for them. It's true. What the hell is going to make you any different from them? Unless you know women, she'll roll her eyes, and you will be forgotten before you even speak. Women do, however, want a good guy like Mom says, but they also want a "man." Weak, submissive, and passive behaviors are the least attractive thing to women. I DO mean all women.

WE WILL MAKE HER YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

It's funny how the same behaviors that most men think are the things they are doing right in a relationship are actually completely wrong: calling women allthe time, buying lots of gifts, letting her take the lead, forcing her to take the lead, being her personal assistant, telling her how much you love her all the time, and letting her make the decisions on where to go and what to do. These are the most unattractive behaviors you can have, and they KILL attraction. Do I have your attention yet?

Women basically RESPOND to two things: social status and the reversal of traditional roles of pursuit, wherein the man chases the woman.

The girls you think are totally innocent and virtuous, if put under the right emotional circumstances, might sleep with a man on the first night, leave their boyfriends for some guy in a bar, or even risk their marriage to spend one night with a guy. Is this some random guy? No. He knows women, and he knows himself. If these women wouldn't sleep with him, they would most definitely feel a strong sense of attraction and arousal in his presence. These men understand women's emotional states, and are able to control and dominate them.
"But my girlfriend wouldn't do that!" Famous last words, my friend...

This is a guy who can turn her on, make her emotional, make herfeel protected, threatened, excited, aroused, nervous, comfortable, and submissive at the same time. He's what you will be soon.

Almost all women have felt it before. It's a feeling in their stomach, and they say it just keeps getting warmer and their body feels totally saturated with arousal hormones, culminating in an almost irresistible urge to "be with" the guy in front of them.

Women are very emotional beings. Not only that, they have feelings about feelings about feelings. Confused yet? Not for long, I promise. Their thoughts, actions, beliefs, desires, passions, fantasies, and daydreams are driven by emotions. What if you had the power to GIVE a woman whatever emotions you wanted? You will. Go ahead and hug yourself now...

Ask any woman what she looks for in a man, and you'll be offered a list of a hundred qualities that they like: being funny, smart, compassionate, romantic, great with kids, educated, wealthy, successful, and being a really good listener are a few. So most men try to have all of these qualities women like. The problem is this: What a woman likes is not the same thing she will respond to emotionally. Why do men who have all these greattraits keep getting rejected, dumped, and walked on by women? Simple; most women don't fully understand what makes their own attraction and emotional doors open up. They will respond to something completely different than what they say that they like.

What makes the same woman who says she wants a nice, funny, and loving guy dump that same guy for a jerk who doesn't treat her well at all? She doesn't really know either. She simply responded to something that made her feel good. It's not her fault. It's nature and biology at work. Women respond emotionally and sexually to social status and leadership. These qualities together create a high-octane mixture of attraction and arousal hormones. Let me show you why.

About a bajillion years ago, if a woman mated with the leader of any given society, her chances of survival and the survival of her offspring were drastically improved. Just because we drink three-dollar bottled water, drive SUVs, have wireless MP3 players and text messaging does not make us immune to biology. Mating with the group leader or the alpha male made it possible for her and her offspring to survive, be well fed, and for them to live longer by way ofprotection. It was not ever something they had to think about; it was programmed through thousands of years of evolution that predates our species. Any animal that mates with their pack leader has a better chance of being protected and having their offspring better provided for. Wolves, for instance, will only allow the pack leader to mate with the females of the group, thereby ensuring the genetic quality of future generations to come. Wolves did not sit down at a table and decide this; it is just how nature works. The females will always try to mate with the males who are leaders of their group. If they don't, they could face death, starvation, and the sacrifice of their offspring.

In high school, the popular guys and the football players were always the ones dating all of the hot girls, weren't they? Most of them, I'm sure, didn't even have all the looks and money. This is called status response: a woman responding sexually or emotionally to a guy with high status. Rock stars and celebrities have the same effect of status response. Social status is a biological indicator of leadership, a primal attraction drive in women. The same principle is applied when the popular kid in school would say

THE PASSPORT

something and everyone would laugh, even if it was not funny at all.

When you buy a beer for a woman, give her flowers, gifts, and lots of compliments, and call her all the time, you are putting her in the lead, forcing her to take a dominant role, the man's role in the relationship. Letting her know she has more status than you do. This is bad, cowboy. Bad. Although women will take the lead if they have to in a relationship, very few are able to feel a gut level attraction to their mate if they are in charge of the relationship. In any sexually charged relationship, polarity must exist to create balance and attraction, a masculine and a feminine; a male and a female must have roles.

Women will ignore their husbands if a celebrity comes over and starts talking to them. There is a gravitational pull of women toward status. Even a husband of ten years will be ignored if his wife feels like the celebrity in front of her has higher status than her husband does. A girl's sexual desires will always gravitate toward a greater being that possesses leadership, dominance, social status, charisma, humor, and confidence. They will always point, like a compass, toward status and leadership.When people say, "Women like jerks," what does that mean? When a woman meets a man who dis. plays very solid, unshakeable con. fidence, dominance, and rude behav. ior, she may still feel attraction because these qualities can be at. tributed to leadership and high. status behavior. Women stay in abusive relationships every day, but there's never any confusion as to who is in charge in the relation. ship. I am by no means saying that women need to be abused, and if you truly believe they do, please throw this book into the fireplace. I'm saying that women, even when in an abusive relationship, still feel the root level attraction we're talking about here. They still feel the presence of confidence, leadership (in a horrible way,) and the alignment with someone who believes he has higher status than she does. It's a man who takes charge, regardless of his

Women will cheat on their husbands, leave great relationships, break off plans with their friends, ditch their boyfriends, and skip work to be with a truly authentic high-status guy who can turn all of her attraction knobs. It's emotions that take the wheel when this happens, and it's extremely difficult for women to ignore these feelings.

---

It happens hundreds of times every day. It may have happened to you. It's your turn to be on the other side of the table.

Sexual attraction is only a response. It is not ever a decision a woman makes. Read that again. Highlight, circle, and underline it. Women are emotionally driven. A woman's emotions at ANY given time will dictate her responses to a man, regardless of anything else going on. Leadership. It's the new you.

Did you know that romance novels account for nearly 50% of books sold in the United States. It's true. If you pick one off the shelf at random, they will mostly agree on one common theme: a woman surrendering to something she feels is "greater than herself"; she's the only woman who can calm down and tame the wild horse, the heroine surrendering to the masculine alpha male who will never be tamed...until he meets her. The number one fantasy during all of my candid interviews was confessed to be a strong, dominant, and aggressive male. One woman said it made her "he's having my baby" light come on immediately.

Women feel attraction much differently than do men: Women feel attraction in the beginning as more of a need to be with a man ratherthan to have sex with him. It's not a choice, a decision, or a logical conclusion she makes. It just happens as a result of who YOU are. She feels the need to be with you regardless of her age, marital status, sexual preference, or even her own beliefs about men. It is something she cannot avoid. You will never be able to give her a speech about why she should like you, why you are cool, or how she should fall for you instead of the lead singer of that bar band from last Friday. When women get highly attracted to a man, emotions start to run the show, and they will do all kinds of seemingly crazy and wild things you never thought possible. Women will do all the things that average guys do when they are really into a girl. Buying gifts, calling a lot, doing favors etc. Once the attraction tables are turned, you have TAKEN the role of the hunted and she has naturally assumed the only position left: the chasing role. This is called "Status Transfer," and most of the seduction and dating process will revolve around this concept. No matter how much a woman is attracted to you, it will multiply exponentially if she has to prove herself to you before you accept her. This gives women validation.

---

If she feels like she earned you, she will behave completely different than if she feels like she has more value than you do.

When a girl is with her friends, she will behave differently than if she had anonymity. Some feel like they might be judged, and some don't want their friends to know that your value is higher than hers. A woman will change when she's isolated with you and her friends are not judging her. When she's able to "let go," it's a whole different story.

Women have a unique sense of guy radar. They are able to tell almost instantly if a guy is the "real deal" or not. Before you even begin speaking, women are able to tell if you are confident or not. But sometimes, confidence can be faked and women don't want to waste time talking to a guy who is not authentic. This is why women unknowingly developed a series of trials for men.

As soon as a man begins displaying alpha-male qualities, girls will start to feel a tinge of natural attraction. As soon as they feel this, their subconscious will begin to worry that you might not be the real deal. She needs to know you're not just a wussy who acts confident for a few seconds. Thereare a few things she's looking for immediately - signs that you have your life together enough to be completely secure in whatever you say and do and are selective, picky, and discerning when it comes to women.

Women need to be able to tell immediately if you are going to take the lead in the interaction, and they will make sure they know for sure within the first five minutes of meeting you. You'll spot this immediately when you start approaching women. Women will tease you, ask you to do crazy favors, make fun of your shirt, ask you what kind of job you have, and basically try to pull the confidence rug out from under you to see how you react. When a woman realizes that your beliefs in yourself are about a thousand times stronger than hers, she will feel embarrassed for having tried to analyze you. This is not something women do deliberately; in fact, most women don't even realize they do it.

## DEBUNKING MYTHS

MYTH: These techniques are manipulative.

TRUTH: What do you think buyinggifts, flowers, paying for dinners, complimenting her all the time, and offering to do outrageous favors is? (And you might not even be the only guy she's doing this to.)

MYTH: Women today want an emotional and sensitive man.

TRUTH: Women need refuge from their emotions. While her emotional states may look like a mountain range, yours should be the line in the center, the flat landscape of manhood. You must be the stronghold for her to cling onto in the storm. Women still need a man who is a good listener, just not a man who will go down into emotional depressions WITH them. You must stay afloat while you listen, no matter how deep she goes, and she must be able to count on YOU to be there at the top.

MYTH: Women enjoy a lot of attention and affection.

TRUTH: This is true if you are in a relationship and it is not overdone. Occasional gifts for special occasions and random times are allowed.

MYTH: You should call her all the time.TRUTH: WOMEN need a man who will be okay with not talking to her every second of the day. If you are independent, it shows that you have your own life to live and are able to continue it without needing to talk to her 24-7. If you are genuinely busy and focused on yourself and your life, this trait will come naturally.

MYTH: Women don't like sex.
TRUTH: Women like sex as much as men do, if not more. Women need to convey this attitude so only the real men who know women will be able to walk through the firewall. It is a game; she's not a bitch.

MYTH: If you're really nice to her, she might date you.

TRUTH: Nice is boring. Be what nature intended you to be: the leader. Take charge and don't give up your power, status, or way of life in exchange for her approval, love, affection, or cooperation. She wants adventure, not a teddy bear who cries with her all the time.

MYTH: You need a good job to be successful with women.

TRUTH: Some of the scrubbiest guys have the hottest women as girl-

---

friends. Why? They have personal status and leadership qualities that command attention and attraction. There's nothing complicated here. Nothing matters if you can convey the traits of the high-status leader (AMG). Now, some women are gold diggers, and you'll be able to spot them easily once you start doing this regularly. They will ask you about your job or your car immediately, or just outright ask you how much money you make. If this happens, leave. Don't be tempted to answer these questions unless she has answered a few of your fun ones first. It's okay to tell the truth, as long as you don't try to brag and dwell on the subject.

MYTH: You have to be good-looking and rich to be successful with women.

TRUTH: Again, nothing matters but your value and your attitude. If you work at a fast food place mopping floors and flipping burgers, but you know how to turn women's emotional control knobs, it doesn't compare to some guy who is a plastic surgeon in Hollywood who kisses up to women, trades his value and social status for a girl's approval, and acts like a big wussy. It's literally that simple.

---

MYTH: Women like lots of compliments.

TRUTH: For all of those who think using this system will be manipulative, this is the ultimate form of manipulation here. Compliments, buying drinks and flowers are a way to buy your approval from women. I never condone being rude or acting like a typical jerk. The power simply comes naturally when you no longer need approval from women to live your life. Once you are free of this burden, your life will change immediately forever.

MYTH: Buying women drinks is the gentlemanly thing to do.

TRUTH: Another way of seeking approval. Buying women drinks gives the impression that you aren't interesting enough to be around unless you buy stuff for them, communicating all the WRONG things about you to her. You are not interesting or important enough that a woman would just want to hang out with you otherwise, so you need to buy them drinks. No way, man. If anything, she should be buying you drinks to keep you interested in HER. While you should always physically be gentlemanly by opening doors, walking on the more danger-

---

THE PASSPORT

ous side of the street, and offering your hand while walking down stairs, you can still be verbally cocky and humorous. If you just have to buy drinks, tell her to buy the first round and you guys will rotate paying for them.

MYTH: Women like to take the lead in relationships.

TRUTH: Feminism has played a nasty role in converting many men into soft males. It began by preaching equality, which was a very forward and positive change in society. But when they started pushing 'sameness' down everyone's throats, men became confused about their roles with women and started backing off. The men who take the lead, and don't back off will be the one's taking your girlfriend from you if you don't. It's not some plot against you, it's just the way that nature on this planet works. The only way to flip things in your favor is to change your behavior to naturally magnetize what you want.

MYTH: My girlfriend loves to tell me what to do.

TRUTH: She most certainly does not. When a man is too soft to take the lead, the other person must step upand do it. It is not something she wanted to happen, but it did. Women do not like to tell a grown man what to do. You are her protector, provider and her refuge from her emotions. Some men will ask a woman where she would like to go, even after she's told them to make the decision five times. The

MYTH: She might not like me if I don't tell her what I do for a living.

TRUTH: Some of the best players in the world tell women all kinds of crazy things. From being a fast food restaurant floor cleaner, to shoestring designer. Women don't really care. The only time they really care is if they are gold diggers, or if you don't have enough value to have anything else going for you. In this case, she will try to find something about you to be attracted to because you are attractive enough on your own.

MYTH: Dinner is the gentlemanly place to go on a first date.

TRUTH: This used to be true. Fact is that women usually find something completely unique and adventurous more attractive and fun than any dinner you could possibly take

her to. I have friends who take women to grocery stores as first dates. While I don’t specifically advocate this, it works for them and they like it. Later, I’ll go over tons of things to do as a first outing. Let’s not call it a date.

MYTH: Women know what they want in a guy.

TRUTH: Women know what qualities they want in a guy who already meets a hundred check boxes on a biological shopping list ingrained in their subconscious. When they say they want a guy who’s funny, they aren’t picturing a disgusting, lazy, and weak guy who also likes to tell good jokes. Follow the system and you’ll have all you need to do it.

MYTH: You should always follow the advice of the magazine dating articles.

TRUTH: Most of the guys or girls writing these articles don’t do actual research to write them. If they do, they ask women directly what they like and what turns them on instead of finding out what ACTUALLY builds attraction and deep-seated lust. The latest thing women

like guys to do or the newest guide to romantic restaurants are all articles designed for men who are in a long-term, seriously committed relationship. The techniques we will go over have been the gold standard for thousands of years, and while we may think our brains have evolved past the point of our stone-age brothers and sisters, they haven't. Society, technology, communication, and all things external to us have changed, but our brains and bodies are exactly the same.

MYTH: Women are innocent, and they don't manipulate men.

TRUTH: Women spend more money on makeup, jewelry, shoes, outfits, and implants than you would EVER spend on clothes, cologne, or anything you might think you need to attract women. Every single woman I've ever interviewed told me they had special tricks and tactics they used to make men chase them and keep their interest level up. It's a cruel world, and unless you are dating a nun, I'd advise you to keep your cool and don't automatically put halos onto women until you get to know them first. The hottest woman you might ever see could be the worst and most psy-chotic, bitchy girlfriend you'll ever have. Just knowing this will help your game immensely.

## THE ALPHA MALE GENTLEMAN (AMG)

Society has changed the face of manhood. It's not automatic anymore, it must be achieved, and only some get there. With feminism, WWII, the American Revolution, deadbeat dads, and men's movement groups on the rise, real men have almost become extinct. Ask anyone you know what the definition of manhood is. No one knows today. The AMG is what people mean when they say the words "real man." How does one become a man? This chapter is about that very concept. The theories in here will all be on your transformation timeline to maximize the adaptation to your own lifestyle. Even your breakfast will taste better once you've embodied the AMG.

Marcus Aurelius described the ultimate man when speaking about Maximus in The Emperor's Handbook:
"Maximus set an example of self-mastery, steadiness of purpose, and good cheer that no circumstance, not even illness could extinguish. He combined in beautiful measuregravity with charm, and he did whatever needed to be done without making a fuss. Everyone believed that what he said was what he thought and that he never acted with an intention to do harm or give of fense. Nothing surprised or frightened him, and he never seemed to be in a hurry or slow to accomplish a task. He was neither intimidated and embarrassed on the one hand, nor aggressive and suspicious on the other. So giving, forgiving, and loyal was he by nature that he appeared to be a man whose virtues were inborn rather than acquired. It is unimaginable that anyone ever felt inferior or superior around him, perhaps as a result of his pleasing sense of humor..."
The "Alpha Male Gentleman" is the title we will use to describe the man who is the ultimate attraction magnet for women. He's the man who women will ditch their friends, their plans, and even their relationships to be with. He's double-o-seven...on crack. He's who you will be when you master this book. Guaranteed.

Women sit up straighter when he enters a room. When he looks away, they fix their hair, lick theirlips, and posture themselves to reveal the sexier parts of their bodies. He's the freakin' man...and while he knows it, he doesn't ever make a big show of it.

We see it everywhere: women with ugly guys. The most gorgeous woman you've ever seen will be making out with some grungy-looking guy holding a skateboard. A French model that leaves the bar with a guy who has his bug exterminator truck parked outside. It happens every day, and there's a code to it all. This code is the 5-2-6 method. Each of these men have either been professionally trained, or they have a very natural set of skills that allow them to dominate a woman's experience of reality and turn all of her attraction control knobs to full volume.

Looks don't matter if you know what you're doing. This took me years to realize. And I want you to learn from this mistake I made in thinking I needed to get the most expensive and perfectly formulated wardrobe, a chiseled body, and perfect teeth before a woman would notice me. It's not true. Read it out loud to yourself. It will save you lots of money and confusion.

The concept of the AMG (Alpha Male Gentleman) can be broken down into two behavior qualities thataffect attraction at a fundamental level: the hunter and the leader. These will be the two mountains I will help you climb, but it's easy if you know the way.

Completely eliminating passivity is the one and ONLY path to being a "real man." Passivity is simply allowing things to happen to you as they naturally would. Just allowing everything around you to operate with no influence from you. Basically, it means not taking charge of anything around you. An AMG controls his surroundings, makes all of his plans, and knows that he is causing his future to be rewritten every minute. When women select men, leaders, deciders, and choosers get picked first.

The AMG has his life together, going to the gym regularly, having a schedule, taking care of his responsibilities, and making sure he's able to find time for himself. The difference between average Joe and the AMG is that while doing all of this, he is ENJOYING himself. You only live once, and he knows this. The AMG is always aware his life could end, and he lives it to the fullest. No one is going to bring him down or distort his view of the world. He loves his life, and he's okay with no women being in it.

In order to be attractive to

---

women, you need to be totally comfortable with the idea of not needing women in your life. You need to make sure that all neediness and jealousy are kept in check. If your life is enjoyable, then you are enjoyable to be around. When you have the belief that all in your life is well and nothing could be better, anyone who does anything with you is but a guest. They make a guest appearance on the only show that matters…yours.

The guys who don’t know how to enjoy their life and still be responsible are a bore to be around. No one is going to have fun when someone is too boring or depressed to be interesting. This is a huge turn-off to women, and you must banish it from your life. When you look depressed, sad, or just plain pissed off about something, people will avoid you, especially women. Women want to latch on to someone’s already good mood because they know that their emotions are unpredictable and that a man who is always in a good mood will be able to stabilize them.

Independence is another indispensable trait of the AMG. Successful AMGs can function fully on their own, and do not need a woman or a babysitter to tell them what their responsibilities are in life. A man who is independent is guaran-teed to bring success into his life. This is a huge bonus light for women. Once a woman knows you are completely in charge of yourself and you know how to operate your life in a way that brings you the most happiness and joy, without any help, it lets them know you won't be needing them for stability, emotional support, financial support, or companionship. Start doing things on your own. Make sure you are always one step ahead of whatever is going on and plan for it. Be the guy who always knows what everyone should do next. You must function on your own before you can allow a woman in your life, or she will either try to take charge or leave you, because she doesn't want to take care of a man. She should need support, not you.

True AMGs are decisive in their lives. They are always in tune with their surroundings and themselves. Being in tune allows them to have confidence in themselves because they know what is coming next. They are able to predict what is coming up the road, and make decisions for the group. He navigates for his friends and always takes charge when everyone else is wondering what is going on. They are more aware of what is going on around them, and they don't need to brag about it.AMGs are typically unavailable when it comes to women. Their time is scarce because they are too busy taking care of themselves and spending time with friends. This is supply and demand at work here. If your time for women is scarce, the demand for your time and affection increases. Remember, addictions form when a drug is not present. No one gets addicted to a drug while they are using it. It is the desire to use it again once the effects have worn off that makes people come back. Live your life. Let her fight for time with you. She will appreciate the feeling that she has earned it when you decide you have time for her. Obviously, this CAN be overdone, so make sure to use this in moderation. This technique and how to use it is in the toolkit.

The AMG sets an example for other men to follow in humility. He is never one to brag about himself. Don't ever do this. The urge to brag when women talk to you will be almost uncontrollable at first, but you must resist. Women will ask you questions to try to get you to brag about yourself. This is a test. Don't do it. If they ask where you work, tell them you clean off beds at a tanning salon; tell them you are a lion tamer. Just don't give them the real job until you've gotten to know them better. If a womanstarts getting a little angry about it, this is also a test. Say, "I didn't think you were like that, but I guess I overestimated you guys. We can't have a conversation without discussing my employment?" If they insist on it, run away. You are either dealing with gold diggers or a psychopath.

There's no need to rush anything. One of the defining characteristics of the AMG, besides good posture, is slow and fluid body movement. Whether you are grabbing your drink, walking, shopping in a mall, talking to someone, or approaching women, you must keep your cool at all times. Rapid movements are a way that primates communicate fear and aggression. This is not you. Think double-o-seven. The movement of your body is the quickest and most accurate way a woman can judge you from across the room. Fast movements, jerky motion, and fidgeting can KILL your game and demolish attraction. Have you ever looked across a room and seen a group of people and instantly, somehow, you could tell who the leader of that group was? He's not wearing a sign on his head, so body language plays a very crucial role in meeting women. You'll notice now that the way the AMG stands will dictate and change the way the peo-ple around him stand. We'll cover this in the toolkit.

One trait you'll always notice is that the AMG NEVER puts down or makes fun of other men. The leader of a pack never puts down lesser males. His job as the leader is to take care of them and make sure they don't get killed. The same concept applies to the AMG. You must be kind, but retain your personal boundaries. Here's a perfected list of the traits, behaviors, laws, and qualities of the AMG.
![img-4.jpeg](assets/The%20Passport%20--%20Chase%20Hughes%20--%20(%20WeLib.org%20)_img-4.jpeg)

Why It All Works
A scientist and psychologist named Abraham Maslow made an incredible observation in 1943. Maslow theorized that all humans must meet a set of basic or funda-mental needs in order to pursue and fulfill greater ones. His model for this was named "Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs." The image here begins with the bottom of the pyramid, wherein the basic physiological needs of life must be met to reach the higher set of needs. These needs are food, water, digestion, breathing, and shelter. While each level has very broad definitions of what needs are to be met, I will concentrate on the needs on the hierarchy pertaining to seduction, interaction, and attraction.

The next level up is safety. Just like the previous level, the needs are applicable to all animals. Safety indicates the need to feel protection from threats, freedom to be comfortable, and especially emotional safety. When you walk up to a group in a bar, the girls are pretty sure that a bomb will not go off, no one will attack them, and they are free to relax. The only element that an AMG is concerned with in regards to safety is the setting of boundaries and limitations. When you initially display the traits of the AMG, the boundaries and limitations are an implied part of the interaction. When a woman senses that she's in the presence of a man with boundaries and limitations, she knows he

---

is stable and she has the SAFETY of knowing you are a man who won't blow up on her, hit her, or threaten her. Having boundaries lets others know that you have well-defined limits on what you will tolerate from yourself and other people. The environment alone almost always meets the first two levels of Maslow's Hierarchy before you even approach.

The next higher level are the needs of belonging and love—not the love that you see in Disney cartoons or chick flicks, but a need to feel needed, appreciated, and validated. When she realizes you are an AMG, she becomes attracted to you. She feels the need to be liked and appreciated by someone with higher status than her. This is the very essence of qualification. When you screen a girl with questions and validate her responses to them, she feels that there are very specific things about her that make her UNIQUE to you. This is the most crucial part of the seduction process.

Esteem is next. Here, the process in the 5-2-6 method of validation takes place, and she feels a strong sense of achievement for making through all of your defenses. Once she knows you are really into her through validationand qualification, she builds a little reputation to herself. She legitimizes that since she was able to win you over and make you like her that she is high status. This phase also includes a great deal of responsibility on her part. She develops, over the course of roughly about 45 minutes, a sense of responsibility and loyalty to you. It manifests itself when she feels a slightly stronger need to take care of you, nurture the ongoing conversation, and try to keep herself on point in order to win you over fully into a relationship.

Actualization is the full realization of the relationship. The beginning of sexual and emotional relationships makes women very nervous and excited in the face of being fulfilled sexually, emotionally, and physically by a man. When a woman sees a man's potential, she sizes up the potential of the relationship and sets mini goals for the relationship before anything has even happened. As she sets these expectations, she feels more and more validated and fulfilled as they are met or exceeded.

Maslow's pyramid is not a method or a technique, but a reference to be understood prior to going out into the war zone of dating and women. It is the perfect example ofwhat women go through to make decisions to start a relationship with a man. It can be applied to almost any interaction, and it is a severely underused tool in society today. Use it.

## TRAINING

![img-5.jpeg](assets/The%20Passport%20--%20Chase%20Hughes%20--%20(%20WeLib.org%20)_img-5.jpeg)

The "FIVE-TWO-SIX" model of seduction:
F-ocus: Hijacking her attention span-hyper focus
I-nterest: Making her realize whom she's talking to
V-alue: Giving her reasons to chase you
E-motional hijacking: Taking control of her state
T-akeaways: Expressing a little interest and finding flawsW-illingness: Qualifying her
O-penness: Showing your "sensitive" side
S-eduction: laying the groundwork for sex
I-nteraction: demonstrating your interest beyond sex
X-the commencement of a physical relationship

The FIVE-TWO-SIX explained:
This is the visual representation of how the 5-2-6 method works. It is presented to you here in gray scale, but can also be viewed and printed in color on my website: www.themenspassport.com.

The bottom of the model represents the 5-2-6 acronym and the ten steps of the attraction and mating process. The left side represents the percentage value of each line as they traverse the chart. The top of the model is the SUGGESTED timeline. (Keep in mind that the entire seduction process can still be done quickly as long as each step is met.)

From the left of the model, moving downward, I'll go over what each line represents.

The first line represents her social status. It represents the status she sees herself in contrast

---

to you. It will go down significantly in the beginning of the approach because you are in the process of SHOWING her where she is on your social scale. She will see herself as almost socially equal to you as time progresses because you are having meaningful conversations and you are making her chase you.

The second line represents her resistance to you. The way she feels about you makes her decide whether to open her doors to you or shut you down. As you progress on the model within the first few minutes of the interaction, her resistance will plummet. As you near sex, her fears of male abandonment and pregnancy will cause a huge spike in her resistance and sexual arousal. It is inside of every woman you'll ever meet. The only thing that will vary is the intensity.

The third line on the model represents your social status in relation to hers. Notice as you approach that your value is significantly lower than hers. She's already put you into the chump basket just because you are approaching her. As you enforce your role as the pack leader, your value will continue to a point above hers and level off with hers during the connection-building phase of the 5-2-6 method.The fourth line represents your openly displayed attraction to her. Even if she's gorgeous and her arouses you, she and her friends can never know until you've reached the W-illingness phase. You'll notice the line leveling off in the interaction phase, and then making a sharp drop before sex. This drop compensates and helps alleviate her fears and concerns that surround the act of sex. You'll learn to display nonsexual interest in her and show her that you are more comfortable than she is about not having sex at all. The line goes right back up and is in cooperation with the other lines on the model. As it climbs, her resistance goes back down and her attraction to you starts climbing with it.

The next line you'll notice is the steadily increasing line starting at the bottom. This represents the escalation of physical touch with a woman. If you've been talking to her for an hour and you haven't made physical contact yet, she will feel uncomfortable because she has not grown comfortable with the thought of openly and outwardly touching you and being relaxed while in contact with your body.

When you first meet, you should shake hands, thumb wrestle etc. to build her comfort levels about be-ing touched by you. As the process progresses, the amount and intimacy of touch will gradually increase. Each step in the method is followed by examples of touching and physical contact that can and should be used within that step. Remember to keep talking while you hold her hand to distract her from objecting, and to ALWAYS break contact before she does. If you sense she might object, remove your hand immediately BEFORE she says anything. Just doing this simple thing can build a whole lot of trust with her.

My personal favorite line to look at is the last line. It makes a very sharp turn upward at the beginning of the interaction. This shows her attraction development throughout an interaction. As you approach, it's at rock bottom; she's thinking about getting rid of you until you open your mouth. As you do, the line begins a dramatic and obvious climb upward and continues to gradually rise throughout the interaction. The rapid drop represents her fears before sex.

The capitalized letters on the model are representations of what milestones should roughly be taking place during the use of the 5-2-6 method. As you can see, holding a girl's hand when you meet her can

---

take place as early as 40 seconds to a minute. The phone number can be obtained in under three minutes and is usually a good reference to shoot for. The "P" on the model is an indicator of what kind of performance to shoot for and is only in that time slot as a goal.

The embrace, initially very short in duration, can take place about ten minutes into the method. You still have to be the one to break the embrace before she can say anything, so make sure it's quick. There will be more on that later.

Kissing will take place from 15 to 45 minutes into the interaction. Flip to the "Quick Kiss Guide" to learn more now.

Intimate touching involves embraces with elongated eye contact, caressing the skin, biting, closeproximity smelling, light hair pulling, deeper kissing, and VERY brief genital contact.

Backing off is the hardest thing to do. It is a deliberate demonstration of disinterest, and it drives her crazy. Women THRIVE on anticipation and sexual tension.

The model is meant to be the universal visual representation of the human mating process. It is possible to break and bend the rules of the method as long as itsbasic structure is followed. It's possible to have perfect skills and kiss a girl after 30 minutes instead of 15. I have seen guys blast through all of the steps in an hour and take a girl home almost immediately.

The entire 5-2-6 method cannot be fully completed in one place. It can be broken up over a few dates, or in one night. It is up to you. Don't try to have a deep conversation in an ear-shattering, noisy club. It's obviously time to go to a quieter place. On the same note, you aren't going to engage in a full-blown make-out session inside of a family restaurant. The final steps are for bedrooms and living rooms of someone's house.

## YOUR TOOLKIT

The techniques in the toolkit should be used interchangeably. Pick and choose them to suit your personality, mood, or desired fun levels.

What you are about to read will change your view of the world.

In the next few minutes, as you skim through the toolkit, you will have a few "holy crap" moments. Eventually, you will be able to create your own lines, stories, and

---

techniques. These techniques are designed for use as much and as often as you'd like until you feel comfortable pushing your own material out into the world. When you first use these, you might get a few funny looks. This phenomenon happens because your words (the techniques) and your body language and voice tones may not match up to each other. The more you use them, the better everything will line up.

When you try to get yourself into a positive, dominant, or playful mind-set, keep in mind that the more you question whether you are "in the mood" or not, you will push yourself further and further from being in the moment and will force yourself to be too self-conscious. When you begin to question what kind of mood you are in, you overanalyze yourself and focus your energy inwardly instead of outwardly. Get into the mood or state of mind BEFORE you go into a place where you are going to meet women.

When you assume the role of the attractive woman and begin treating her like most women treat guys, the power will astonish you.

Answer the following questions before you proceed:

1. What do "perfect" and gorgeous women treat men like?
2. What do incredibly hot womensay to men who try to pursue them?
3. What things do hot women say and do to make men chase them?
4. How does the average guy (you) feel when he is talking to a super-model-quality girl who seems almost flawless?

On the male side, where men look for thighs, breasts, beauty, and sexiness, women look for leadership, dominance, fun, confidence, and social status. Our T\&A is their AMG.

## Approach by Situation

There are more ways than I can count to meet women, and even more ways to screw it up. When you are in a bookstore, you cannot do the same things you would do in a bar or club. Here's a breakdown of locations and recommended styles to use. We'll go from the lowest environmental stimulus and work our way up.

Coffee Shop: Coffee shops are great for meeting women. They have become the new clubs. When you are in a coffee shop, it's quiet, and women aren't in a club environment where their natural defenses are up against men. Here, you have two basic options: a direct approach,wherein you will immediately tell her you like her and you want to get to know her but you have to go; and two, if she's with a friend, a more indirect approach like asking for a woman's opinion on something. Both will work to get you a number or email quickly. Another awesome approach question is to use a "relationship" question. We'll cover that in the approach guide.

Bookstore: Bookstores offer the luxury of always having something to talk about. You can grab a book on almost anything and use your imagination. Grab a book on dating, for instance, and use it to ask a question about your "friend," who just text-messaged you a question about his girlfriend. There's plenty of space to walk with her, and there's usually a coffee shop you can lead her to after about ten minutes of game. You will always, however, need to use the approach guide in the toolkit when you structure any kind of approach.

Mall: Women flock to malls. Every woman there will have different things going on in her day that will affect her responsiveness to you, but with the high-status qualities you will soon have, it won't matter. If you have a girl byherself, it's best to use a very direct approach and get her number fast. If her friends are there, you'll have to butter up the defensive line before you can get a good number. This only takes a couple of minutes if done correctly. It's all in the toolkit. In the malls, just concentrate on having the "greatest day of your life" mentality. When you approach in a store, make her try funny stuff on, dare her to say weird things to the employees, and make fun of how much of a "good girl" she is. Keep it light, involved, and fun. There's no substitute quality for fun. Even if you're rich, smart, good-looking, and famous...fun is the key.

Street: On the street, women are thinking about errands, family, friends, and their own lives. When you approach on the street, always ask a relationship question. This usually ties into their already-inprogress thought process and makes it easier for a quick scribbling of the number or email. The street is a little harder because if you stop someone walking the opposite direction, they start to become concerned about their schedule. If the girls are walking in the same direction as you are, you either have to slow way down or run up to them,

---

which automatically puts your status into the sewer. Just don't do it, or find a way to approach from a different angle.

Bars and Clubs: Bars and clubs will almost never reward a guy using a directly interest-conveying approach. Bars and clubs are an extremely high-stimulus environment, so to approach here, you need to be more interesting, commanding, and fun than the environment (most girls are there to hang with their friends, get drunk, and let the music and flashing lights distract them from the problems in their daily lives) around you. The relationship and childhood questions are best suited for bars and clubs. You've got to be loud and project over the noise to be heard and understood. This is where most guys think they will get laid, get lucky, and find a decent girlfriend. Just because there is more to choose from and they are wearing slutty clothing does not mean that the women there are of good quality. The best reports I get from my students are from when they approached girls in the daytime: a store, mall, or even a fast-food joint. Don't get me wrong; there is a lot to be said about the nightlife, but the best girlfriendsyou'll get will be a result of a daytime non-club environment. All the techniques you'll ever need to meet and keep women are in here.

# THE 5-2-6 METHOD EXPLAINED 

Here it is: the secret method. Each phase has a brief description of what it is and what's going on in her head during this phase and is followed by an all-inclusive list of the most advanced techniques available to fully accomplish each step.

This system is an indirect system in that it does not communicate your desire to be with her immediately. Rightly so, she has not yet earned your presence until you make sure she is what you want.

During the daytime, if a woman is alone, or with one friend in a store, let's say, you may elect to use a direct approach. I'll cover this in detail following the system.

About Rejection: No professional

---

athlete became that way overnight. They hit thousands upon thousands of practice balls, threw millions of passes, or beat the living crap out of hundreds of punching bags. For a few months, treat these women as your practice balls; they are there only to serve as a rung on your ladder to success. Some of the best players in the world have been rejected and ridiculed more times than anyone you've probably ever met before. Becoming the AMG is a PROCESS, not an overnight metamorphosis. Remember that you will be approaching men and all kinds of women you happen to see. This is the best and most effective way to build your skills as quickly as possible. If you don't do this, it's only going to take longer. I promise.

Here's the full and complete guide to the 5-2-6 system. Examples are listed after the description of each phase of the system and should be used, mixed around, and changed however you want. They are a guide and not an oracle. Each man's personality is different and might better be reflected by the use of varying the timing, tonality, and word choice of each example.

Do whatever you have to do to make her ugly and completely repulsive in your mind. Imagine all the

---

problems she might have, the disgusting guys she's been with, or worse. Just make sure you don't FEEL a whole lot of attraction because it will "leak" out in your body language whether you like it or not.

When a lot of my students started, they got in a huge rush to recite everything they memorized as fast as they could, hoping the words were the key to the girl's heart. It's not true. Remember to pause for effect, and speak as though you have all the time in the world. As soon as you begin using pauses in normal conversation and while meeting women, the attention-grabbing power will amaze you. People are somehow drawn to pauses when they are timed to precede a good part in a story, a point being made, or even the end of a question.

The 5-2-6 is an art form that fluctuates and varies in its scientific precision. Keep it fun, throw funny stories in whenever you feel like the conversation is flatlining, excuse yourself in the middle of the model to go talk to other girls in the bar, and feel free to bail on any woman whenever you want to. Follow the guideline and the method, but don't get caught up in thinking you need todeliver a specific line to her when your watch says it's been three minutes and 45 seconds. The method is designed to be a fluid human exchange instead of a hardened set of timelines, rules, and phrases. Follow the steps and the examples, and the method will work for you.

## F-OCUS

Focus is all about the ability to make a woman ignore or forget something else that is otherwise important to her. Her friend is tugging on her sleeve and telling her it's time to go, but she's fixated on what you are saying. There are two basic ways to achieve this. Touching her for the first time takes place now.

Take a look at the black line on the model. At the beginning, it depicts the perceived level of social status you have at the beginning of the approach. As soon as you walk up, you have work to do. She immediately puts you into the chump category before you speak, simply because you are approaching her like all the others. When you build high focus, she will understand that she's wrong about you. Your value, as you progress in the approach, will steadily increase and

---

level off just slightly above hers. This illustrates that you should never put her down out of anger, meanness, or fear. Simply keeping a moderate level of sexual tension and making her focus on you makes this line stay above hers. Also notice that when you walk up, her value is above yours.

This is the number one place where men get fear and anxiety for no reason. Most guys will see a woman and immediately launch into the thought cycle of "What opener do I use?" and keep running it over in their heads until they have either made the woman freaked out from staring, or she has left the area. Don't let this happen to you. The only reason men have so much fear around this is because they think that this one woman will somehow either reject them and go tell every other woman on the planet, or if they aren't able to get her, there won't be another one like her in ten thousand years. When you approach and go into the FOCUS stage, you must understand that she is only one single woman and there are hundreds more within only miles of you that you will be able to get as soon as you are finished with her. There really is no possible way that anything bad can come of approaching a woman. You will still feel the fearof approach, but you must keep going, because the only way to eradicate it is to get as many as you can over with.

When you approach a woman, you must be more important than anything else going on. Walk as if you are going to walk right by her, but stop as if something has just occurred to you and keep your body in the direction you were walking. Don't turn your body into hers just yet. She will earn that privilege. When you speak to her, speak in a resonating voice. A voice with lots of vibration and resonance is the one you're looking for. Don't concentrate too much on volume.

Right now, put your hand on your chest and say "ninety- nine." You can make a good vibration without making your voice too deep. Keep it the same tone you normally use, but increase that vibration you feel in your chest. When you feel the vibration the strongest, this is your real voice. The one you would have if society didn't tell you to be quiet and submissive so you don't piss anybody off.

Girls get approached, whistled at, stared at, complimented on ridiculous things, and asked lame questions all the time. The frequency with which most good-looking women get approached would shockyou. So, when you approach, you need to immediately distinguish yourself from the multitude of other boring, ass-kissing guys who have been hitting on her since she was probably 16. Here's the secret. The first thing in her head when a guy walks up is that you are going to be one of those other morons. So, to combat this, you'll use an old sales technique called limiting the product. Tell her you only have a second, 'cause you have to be somewhere soon, but you need a quick opinion on something. Remember not to say the words "ladies" or "girls," like some kind of weird player guy. Use "hey, guys" or just plain "hey." This combo has worked for my students for five years, and they've never gone out without this powerful tool.

During this phase, you will approach the group and will encounter some resistant body language and maybe a little verbal resistance. As far as they are concerned, you are just one of the thousands of men who will hit on them this year alone. Before you speak, you will be judged. You will demonstrate AMG body language, and completely control the conversation for about one minute and cause them to realize who you actually are. As you start to do this, you'll notice theirbody language starting to slowly face into you, their attention coming to focus on you, and the overall mood of the group will lighten and become more humorous. You will start to hear giggles and positive laughs, and you will see a change in the acceptance posture of the group. YOU did this. When you address the whole group, you can create a focal level that is astonishing as long as you keep volume and authority in your voice. Fun comes next. Do not go directly into a group of women and approach the one girl you want and talk only to her. This will ruin the interaction from the start. While this is a safe bet, it IS possible to just reach out, grab a girl out of a group of girls, and pull her to you so that all you have to do is talk to her, but this level of game will require a bit of practice.

Now it's time for your question. We have plenty of samples in the toolbox here, but the trick to making up your own is that it fits three requirements:

1. It doesn't make her have to do any super deep thinking to come up with an answer. It should be a yes or no answer, or have very little thought involved in order to answer you.
2. It should be interesting. Noth-ing boring is going to score you any points for attaining focus. It should involve celebrities, relationships, movies, or a current event.
3. It should involve women, relationships, metaphysical subjects, or something from childhood.
A good way to give your approach a little more authenticity is to have a friend text a bunch of questions to you on your phone and keep the messages in your inbox. When you approach, have the phone out with the message displayed and act as though you just received the text message.

When you approach women, you will feel your body start to send out chemicals that make your heart beat faster. You might get nervous, as most ALL men do. This is energy that your body produces as a result of biology. Seventy thousand years ago, you might have needed this, but not now.

Watch a few movies with Brad Pitt in them. Notice he's usually eating something while he is doing something else. Doing this shows you have more to do than just talk to whoever it is. You are busy doing something else. This also aids in expending that nervous energy you feel. If you walk up to a group

---

while chewing gum, eating an apple, or sucking on a lollipop, it can tremendously reduce your anxiety and nervousness. Even the most successful players have this reaction when they approach. You will get used to it, and it will only be a tingle in your brain when you've got a few months of experience under your belt.

Remember; you MUST be more fun and more energetic than they are. You don't want to go into the group and have them thinking that you brought THEM down. You have to be happier and more confident than anyone there. Don't be energy-needy; you should be the one issuing it out to everyone in the group.

FOCUS TOOLS: (To accompany a relevant story)

1. "When you guys were kids, did you think a watermelon would grow inside of you if you swallowed one of the seeds?"
2. "I've been arguing about this all day with my friend; he thinks that mostly women believe in ghosts. Is that true? Do you guys all believe in ghosts or not?"
3. "My friend and I have a bet going...have you seen Batman? You know how the costume has the molded-inpecs and abs? Ok, did the costume have nipples on it or not? My friend thinks there were like huge nipples on the costume. What were they for? Did he make batmilk? I seriously don't think that there were any nipples on the Batman costume."
4. "Do you think really hot women are a little more crazy than other women? I think my friend's girlfriend is psycho. Get this...she wants my friend to cut off all ties to his friends that are female and delete them from his cell phone. He's putting up with this because she's hot, but I'm trying to tell him that beauty is so common. It's either given to you, or you write a check for it. Do you guys do this stuff?"
5. "When you guys eat Captain Crunch cereal, does it tear up the roof of your mouth or not?"
6. Draw a stick figure with a triangle dress on and a smiley face and walk up to her, even if she's with a group. Tell her you are a professional artist and you've been working on a sketch of her for two hours and be very slow and hesitant about handing her the napkin. When she looks at it, don't have a joking face on-act like you are very proud of it and then slowly ease into a smile. As soon as shelaughs, you can shoot a relationship question or any other approach you like. This is an awesome way to break her emotional state and tear down her barriers to attraction.
7. "Have you guys ever seen a ghost?" (Roll into the ghost story here.)
8. "Have you guys ever seen the Sound of Music? My friend and I were trying to remember what the favorite things were in the movie from that 'Favorite Things' song. If you can remember some, I'll...well, I'll give you high-five or something."
9. "Do girls like guys who are total video game nerds? What if the guy plays manly games? My friend thinks that because he plays shooting games or whatever that it's manly and it makes it okay for him to be plugged into the game box all the time."
10. Walk up to group and act convincingly gay. Get a girl's opinion on something about relationships with men. Confess after she's finished talking that you aren't gay.
11. "Hey, can you cook?" (Wait for response) "What the hell is juniper? My friend texted me this recipe and it says I need juniper."

## Routines/Stories

Here is a list of story ideas, ex-amples, and the ultimate guide to putting together your own stories to maximize attraction potential. Use tonality, facial expressions, and body language to your advantage. Study great comedians like Dane Cook, Jerry Seinfeld, and George Carlin.

Story-Telling Guide:
Using your own stories from your life is great because you can use them without having to rehearse anything and it will automatically look natural. When you tell stories from your life, make sure you include six basic principles in them.

1. Humor (the most important element)
2. Leadership (showing that others look to you)
3. Vivid descriptions (generous use of adjectives and sensory words)
4. Good body language (this will make or break your story)
5. Use sound effects, cool demonstrative body language, and gestures.

Examples:
Do you believe in ghosts?
Get this; my phone rings at like 2 a.m. this morning and I usually don't pick it up, but I did. My friend was completely frantic. He says, "Dude, get over here NOW!" I'm like, "Calm down, bro." And he said, "Dude, I just saw a ghost walkacross my bedroom. I'm selling this house tomorrow. I can't go back inside. I need you here, now.* So I put on my flip-flops and go over. I get to his house and he's standing in his driveway behind the gate in his pajamas with a baseball bat over his shoulder and his eyes are huge. He wants me to search his house, but I make him come with me to show him there is nothing there. He grabs on to the back of my shirt and walks behind me through the whole house. I get pretty freakin' scared, but we don't find anything. He's still selling his house, though, and he let me keep the baseball bat, but I think he's crazy.

## Accidental Sex Party

My friend and I were at this stupid VIP party for the release of his book last week and we got invited to this "house party." (Make the quotations gesture.) We took these directions to this house. It was nice and everyone seemed cool, but like thirty minutes into the party, we saw like three couples making out in the living room, so we just went to the patio. Everyone started getting undressed. All of these gross, fat people started taking

---

clothes off. Chris thought it was cool and was like, "Dude, it's a swinger party," but I grabbed his arm and we ran out of the front door. I'm freaked out and I'm thinking they're going to chase us down or something. Just as we get outside, my friend runs back in, smacks this dude on the ass, and runs back outside to get into the car. I felt so dirty just thinking about what was going on after we left. It was disgusting.

# Watermelon Seeds 

My friend Dan is a huge hypochondriac. We all brought watermelon to this volleyball party the other day and he runs over to me completely freaked out and tells me he swallowed a seed instead of spitting it out. I try to tell him he's an idiot, but he starts trying to make himself puke right in front of my co-workers and friends. Now everyone is staring at him and then looking back at me. (Body language demo) So I yelled out that he had food poisoning to cover up his complete stupidity. As soon as I did, people started looking at their food and walking over to ask me what he ate. I had to make up this huge story because our friend is an idiot, and I think I lost a few party invites over that shit.## The Costume Shop

My friend and I were in this costume shop earlier today and we saw this Batman costume. When we get together we cause all kinds of trouble. He puts this thing on and runs over to this girl that works there and tells her to be Robin. She puts on a Robin mask and he grabs her and starts kissing her with this mask on. I'm thinking we'll be in jail soon, but she starts kissing him back. This nerdy-looking guy-I guess he was the manager or something-comes out and I look at him and I am like (make the shhhh gesture with your finger on your lips) and he just stands there and watches. I guess this goth chick is supposed to be meeting us tonight, but I think she's kinda creepy.

## The Sound Of Music

We were in the video store last week and I saw that movie on the shelf. My friend said she hadn't seen it in a long time, so we bought it. As soon as we got back to my house, she ran into the living room and started singing that 'My Favorite Things' song and dancing all over the place like a complete idiot. (Body language demo) I busted out my camera real quick (body language demo) and I made a

---

THE PASSPORT

video of her singing and dancing all over my house. I posted it on that video website and emailed her a link to it. I wrote the title as 'A Hot Girl Singing' and she got so pissed off when she saw it had been viewed like a thousand times. I told her I would delete it, but I think she likes it. Girls are such dorks.

The Koala Bear

I was in Australia last year and this weirdo on the street solicits my friend and me to go and see a koala bear show. We thought it sounded fun and we took a cab to this address on the brochure. When we got there, everything looked really respectable and clean. The audience was only like a dozen people or so, and the "show" went on pretty normal; some kangaroos hopped around and did a trick, some wallabies came out and did a silly little dance, but as they neared the end of the show, we smashed through a wall into the twilight zone. I swear to god. The host of the show looked like the crocodile hunter and talked exactly like him. When the end of the show was approaching, he introduced this little koala bear. (Do the accent and body language here; not to entertain them, but because you are soexcited about the story. Do it for yourself. This is the difference between being a performer and a leader.) As this koala came out, this fat little assistant girl came out and picked him up as he waddled over to her. The host started talking about how much fun koalas have and how they 'love to play.' As she picked him up, I SWEAR TO GOD, she started rubbing his little koala penis. THERE WERE KIDS AT THIS SHOW!!!

Anyway, everyone got a little uncomfortable, but we were frozen in place. She started rubbing and massaging his penis, and his little fuzzy koala head started tilting back in sheer pleasure. His little eyes closed and he had koala juice squirt out. Everyone in the audience was completely shocked. One guy got up and left, and my friend Nick was watching and reaching into his bag for his camera at the same time. By the time he got pictures, we were both completely hysterical with laughter. My face hurt so freakin' bad from laughing.

## Mom and Dad

My friend and I were in his car the other day, and he has one of those Bluetooth things that goes to his speakers. We were in the middle of a new CD he just bought when thephone rang. When his phone rings, it mutes the CD player so you can talk in the car. He picked it up and his dad accidentally called him from his pocket or something. But it wasn't the usual pocket-call noises we were hearing. His sickass parents were making out, and I swear to god I heard some lovemakin' on the phone. His face was solid white and I thought he was going to faint...or vomit. He tried to push the off button, but I fought him and turned up the volume so I could listen. He did NOT think it was funny. He made me get out of his car at a gas station, and I had to have my girlfriend come and pick me up. He won't return any of my calls, but I'm sure he'll get over it.

## FOCUS TOUCH LADDER

1. Handshake: Launch into thumb war as soon as you shake hands if you think she's into it.
2. The "Daps": Hold out your fist instead of shaking hands. Most men never do this to women and it will make you stand out. When she goes to give you the "pound," tell her she doesn't know how to do it. Teach her the right way by using her hand (playfully) and going into "slow mo."

---

3. Pointing at her clothes and touching them while you are either making fun of them or just looking. Note: Don't ask her what the fabric is. It's lame.

# I-NTEREST 

This phase begins after you've made yourself known and you are being listened to. This is where you build her interest in you. Here, you make her realize that you are having a better time than she is. You will make her think, "Wow, I wasn't having much fun until HE came over here."

Look at the dark blue line on the model. It represents her attraction to you. Notice a HUGE spike as soon as you reach this phase.

A woman's interest level is dictated and controlled by reactions to stimulus. Here, you will grab her emotional steering wheel and begin the process of making her chase you. The examples are designed to communicate and demonstrate indifference and disinterest. Why do this? She hasn't earned your interest yet and will need to do a little work to get it. You will immediately see a reaction when you use these tactics, and you

---

THE PASSPORT

will be tempted to pause and let her react to them. Don't. Just use them and continue with another story. You are deliberately creating a social void in the interaction.

One thing about voids is that we all want to fill them. When you create a gap in the interest level, a woman will naturally want to fill the void. When you tell a girl she's not your type, she feels the need to prove otherwise. A void in attraction is more powerful than any tool in this kit.

You need to maintain the attention of the whole group, here. Be loud and speak without hesitation.

When you first start a conversation, you must openly show disinterest, an AMG quality. One way to do this is to make her think you are not into her at all. If you are confident and strong, she will begin to wonder why. Eventually she will want to prove you wrong. All of this is done in good fun. They are meant to do two things: throw her off guard and make her chase you. You're saying something you like about her, but something unusual that might make her a little self-conscious. Remember...this is all about fun. If you aren't smiling and having an awesome time, she will sense it and your words willcome out differently. If you say these lines like a rude jerk, you won't get the response you're looking for. They have to be delivered in a fun and playful way. Remember, you want her to be operating on a sense of loss for just a few minutes.

Imagine if you saw a piece of paper blowing on the sidewalk. What would you think? It's just a piece of litter, right? But then, when you look closer, you realize it's a hundred-dollar bill. As it blows away from you, an instinct to chase it and pick it up comes over you. It's the same principle with women. When you walk up to a group, you are just another guy. But once you start demonstrating awesome body language and they realize you are having a better time and have higher status than they do, the attention shifts. You become valuable. They become interested.

Don't overuse these. A couple will do the job. Pick your favorite ones, find out which ones work for you, and keep them in your pocket. When you deliver these, they should just be a part of the conversation initially. Simply say it and keep talking.

In this step, you will begin the touch progression. It starts with the slightest and most nonsexual of

---

physical contact. A handshake is a perfect example of this. When you shake her hand, launch into thumb wrestling.

Talk to her friends, too. Don't neglect the group or they will keep her there and you will lose the ability to take her away from her friends in the future steps of the 5-2-6.

1. "If you were a librarian I'll bet you'd be one of those librarians at school who yell at all the kids and make them stand in the corner."

2. "Are you on a bowling team?"

3. "My friends all wanted me to meet you. We can play along, but in all honesty...you're not my type."

4. "You smell like marshmallows! I love it!" (This one must be done as if marshmallows are your favorite things in the world.)

5. "You are so cute! If I wasn't gay, I'd probably be hitting on you right about...now." (Yes...this works. She knows you're joking, or will work to find out if you are. This also works well for groups with guys in them.)

6. "You have the coolest-looking ears. I want a picture of them! They are so cute!" (Bust out your camera or camera phone and take a picture of her ear. Re-member to smile.)
7. "Were you in the chess club in high school? You have a smartgirl vibe."
8. "I'll make a bet with you... I'll bet you that you can pick any dude in here and I'll walk you over to him and introduce you...ANY GUY in here...I'll bet he's boring." (You should deliver this as if you are only making a joke about stupid men, not a bet. They won't take the bet anyway, though.)
9. "You just made me so hungry!" (Pause very briefly for a response.) "Your hair kinda reminds me of an awesome blossom. It's so cute. I never see that style; I love it!

## INTEREST TOUCH LADDER

1. Fake palm reading: You can use this as a touch-building technique. Take her hand in yours and pretend to read her palm, but tell her that her palm says she will be a dork for eternity.
2. Body language demonstrations: Use her in your stories to illustrate a point, show how your "friend" was standing with some girl, or to demonstrate a girl's body language in one of your stories. Gently grab her and move her into the demonstrative position.

---

3. The elongated hand-hold: When you make contact with her hand through fake palm reading, etc., hold her hand just a little longer than usual. As you're holding her hand, let your arm relax and lower naturally as you continue talking. This will distract her while she unknowingly becomes used to your touch. Be sure to break contact first.
4. Reaching up and pulling a few hairs back behind her ear. (Do this nonchalantly while telling a story or anytime when she won't interrupt to say anything about it.)

# V-ALUE 

Here you will show her that she's just slightly below us on the social food chain, while we also build a little bit of sexual tension and attraction. There are easy ways to do this. During this phase, you also reveal one childhood short story. You will hold hands with her, lock arms to walk somewhere, or simply move her a few feet to break her out of the mental bubble she was in before you came around.

Value is defined as the ability to boost someone's social status or beliefs about their social statusby virtue of sheer presence or association. In one word, value is coolness. Value is the quality or condition of being more socially desired and attractive than others. In this step, you will screen her to make sure she is desirable to you. This also enforces the feeling for her that she is "earning" your affection.

In this phase of the system, you will demonstrate your ability to withstand any kind of test or trial they decide to throw your way. It's designed to get you up the steep incline of the value line in the initial phase of the interaction. Take a look at the diagram and notice how quickly your value makes a climb in this phase.

When you deliberately make fun of something unique and you also say that it's something you like at the same time, she quickly realizes she's not dealing with a guy who gets nervous around women. She also realizes that you understand how to build sexual tension, your weapon of mass attraction. Being playful and fun demonstrates that you aren't fixated on making her like you. This is a refreshing feeling for women when a man has no sense of neediness. Showing your freedom from social conditioning and a lack of insecurity is instantly magnetic

THE PASSPORT

and attractive. Before you start screening her to be with you, make sure you throw in a story and at least one game or role-playing technique from the story section.

Toward the end of this phase, and into the beginning of the next, she will most likely throw a few standard questions at you that she throws at every guy. When she asks you what you do, where you work, what your name is, or where you are from, don't answer the question. Be fun about it, but don't answer it right away. Either tell her you will let her know in a minute, make her test her psychic powers, or make up an obviously joking answer and if they ask again, go ahead and give it to her.

When you've established Value, it's a perfect time to end the conversation and get her number. When you ask for the digits, make sure she's in a happy and focused frame of mind. The way to achieve this is by telling a quick story that has good humor and adventure that only lasts about a minute. When she's in this good state, execute the techniques at the end of the three-minute phone number technique: Tell her it was cool to meet her and you hope to run into her again. As you instill the sense of loss by walking away, turn back around and gofor the digits. Hand her your phone, ask for hers, or just say, "Hey, give me your number, I want to chat some more."

Another technique for getting the number here is to use a highly descriptive story with a huge buildup to the ending and cut it off as you look at your watch. Tell her you have to go, but you'll finish later. Use the same technique to finish.

When she is in a positive and focused mood as you leave her, it reduces the chance of having her send you to voice mail for a week. She remembers the last encounter with you as a positive one, and she understands why you like her.

## VALUE TOOLS (After a quick, high-

energy story)

1. Are you a good interior decorator? It seems like you have a pretty good sense of style.
2. Are you a good friend? I think that is really important in life.
3. Are you a pretty organized person, or does your house have piles of laundry everywhere?
4. You're not one of those live-in-the-club types of girls, are you?
5. Are you a writer or something? I don't know...the way you talk sounds like you'd be a pretty good writer.

---

6. I bet you have stacks of laundry and stuff all over the house.
7. I bet your bathroom countertop is completely covered in a girl stuff like hairbrushes and makeup and stuff.
8. Do you have plants in your house? (If not) Why, do you think you would kill them? (If she says yes, tell her that's an awesome sign that a girl is emotionally mature. It's important to you that she is, so she impresses you now.)
9. Do you do fun stuff? Boring people are so...well, boring. Ha-ha. (Let her talk.)
10. Have you ever stalked a guy? (Still kind of smiling.)
11. There are really two things I look for in a girl: She has to be honest and she has GOT to have a positive view of her own life. It seems like you've got the positive thing down pretty well. (Leave her hanging on the honesty part, and if she asks, tell her you don't know her well enough yet.)
12. I'm going to kick your ass...I bet you say this crap to all the guys, don't you? (A line women use all the time.)
13. God, I hope you aren't a weirdo... you better warn me if you are...I'm serious." (Totally joking tone.)## VALUE TOUCH HIERARCHY

1. Hand holding: When you take her by the hand, don't keep looking down at it or squeeze any harder than she is. Keep the leading position and be completely comfortable with the fact that you can take her by the hand. She will be okay with it if you are. The simple way to make sure you are comfortable is to ask yourself, "How would I do this if I did this all the time and it was no big deal for me?"
2. The happy face technique: When she impresses you, makes you laugh, or says something you like, give her happy faces on her "report card." When you give her a happy face, make the motion of quickly pulling a sticker off of a card and putting it on her arm. This sounds juvenile, but it works wonders as well as building more touchcomfort.
3. Interlocking arms: When you are moving her, using her in a demo, walking with her, always walk in front of her and hold out either your arm for her to hook into, or your hand for her to hold while you travel through an area.
4. Pick an imaginary piece of dirt or something off of her shirt. Make sure you aren't grabbingany breasts or the deal will most likely be off.

## E-MOTIONAL HIJACK

Here, we completely rack her brain. You will be able to dominate her thoughts and make her start to feel what feels like love at first sight. A more intimate touch: You will make her touch you this time. This is a very short step, so it's essential to have the stories you are going to tell rehearsed and polished. This step is simple and easy as long as you can let her speak, ask the right questions, and keep her senses involved.

Once her attraction levels start to climb, it opens her vault doors and reveals all of her secret attraction and emotional control knobs. Once you go inside, however, you have to know what you are doing, or risk crashing the system. A woman's emotions are easy to control if you have the map.

She's feeling all kinds of emotions right now: She's attracted, nervous, scared, and worried about what her friends are thinking of her. Here, you may want to get a number and bail, or continue themethod in a different location. If you are in a loud bar or club, go outside or find a table so you can actually talk to her. If you are in a daytime place where it's relatively quiet, just move her a few feet. Here, you will move her to another location in the club, bar, or store you are in. Not to a different one yet. If you tell her friends you are going to take her on a walk for a second, they won't have any problems with it because you have not told her or communicated publicly that you are attracted to her. She probably doesn't even know yet either. Just take the lead, tell her to come with you, and stick your hand out. She has already touched you based on the touch hierarchy, so it won't be a big deal.

When you find yourself involved in conversation, resist every urge to agree with her about all of her likes and dislikes. If she says she loves eating jelly doughnuts, don't be afraid to say you hate them. It's okay because there WILL eventually be something you genuinely both agree on. Resist the urge to kiss her ass and tell her you like everything that she likes. She knows that guys who say "me too" to everything she likes are wussies.

EMOTIONAL HIJACK TOOLS

1. A sensory-rich story about a place you’ve been to. Describe the colors of the ocean, the feeling of the sand, the smells of the cooking, etc.

2. While exchanging stories, make her use more sensory words; if she’s not using any, ask her questions about the more detailed experiences within her story.

3. Make her tell you a secret.

EMOTIONAL HIJACK TOUCH HIERARCHY

1. Notice something on her arm or hand: Make notice of a freckle, birthmark, or scratch on her arm or hand. When you announce it, reach out and lift her arm/hand into your view to look at it. As you do, keep going with a story or a routine while you look at it. When you are finished looking at it, let go.

2. Use her to demonstrate a funny picture you saw of a couple hugging or posing for a photographer.

3. Grab her hand and put it in yours. As you do, look around the place and talk about how she has to be your bodyguard from all the other women. If she lets go of your hand or looks at your actions awkwardly, don’t make a big deal out of it. Just rollyour eyes at her like she's too silly to realize who she's with and start talking to someone else for a minute or two to rebuild the sense of loss.
4. Make her sit on your leg if there is a shortage of chairs. When you bring her over to sit on your leg, tell her not to try anything funny. Be resistant.

## T-AKEAWAYS

Here, you'll find reasons why you'd never work together and make her argue with you why not. You will make her begin the actual chase at this point.

People have an innate need to fill gaps in social space. Like we talked about earlier, she will take up the void or space you create. When you deliberately create a void in the conversation, it causes her to feel yet another sense of loss. She will naturally feel a need to get you back into the conversation by means of pulling you closer, talking louder, or making more overt passes at you.

In this step, she already wants to be with you. Just by sheer presence alone, she is letting you know she wants you to stick around. When you ask her unique questions about

---

herself, she will want to respond with enthusiasm. As soon as you respond with equal excitement about her answer, she will rejoice inside that you guys have something in common that both of you are excited about. As soon as you express excitement in her answer, you will execute a quick shot of frustration in the realization that you are starting to feel attracted to her. She will pursue you even harder now. The more she sees you acting confused and irritated that you feel attraction for her, the more she will try to bring it out of you.

This is the beginning of the important personality-demonstration phase.

TAKEAWAY TOOLS

1. "Hey, what do you do for fun? And don't say anything that takes place indoors. What! Oh my god! You aren't supposed to say that! You're going to get me in so much trouble! I'm supposed to be this uber-bachelor!" (As soon as you say this, act completely surprised and turn your back on her in a joking, childish way and wait for her to re-start the interaction.)

2. "We would sooooo never work. I would be running through yourliving room with the hugest pil-
low I could find and start beat. ing the crap out of you. Either that or I would draw the cutest little mustaches on you if you ever fell asleep near me."
3. "Okay, I have a serious question for you...do you drink out of the cartons of juice and milk and stuff in the fridge or not?" If she says yes, tell her you do the same thing and you were hoping she would say that because you think that's one of the defining qualities that can tell you whether a girl is cool or not. Remember, you want her to know that you are resisting being attracted to her. If she says no, tell her you hoped she would say that because you totally agree with her on that and it's one of your major pet peeves. You had a roommate who did it all the time and it drove you crazy. Follow this up by saying, "I totally can't hang around with you now...that was the ONE thing I hoped we would disagree on. I guess I have to keep prodding, huh?" Do another turn around and cross your arms really dramatically.

## TAKEAWAYS TOUCH HIERARCHY

1.Hand around her while moving,talking to other people.
2.Hand-holding with interlocked fingers.

## W-ILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT HER

Here you will tell her specific things you like about her that she's never heard before. These will validate her experience with you. She does not want to feel like a slut, so this is why we are making sure she knows exactly why we like her. Kissing will happen here.

Nothing is more satisfying to women than the feeling of having earned a man's affection. The watchword in WILLINGNESS is "validation." When you validate parking, you give it justification and reason. The same goes for your girl.

She needs a justification for being with you and for being so attracted to you so fast. Chances are that she hasn't ever felt this way about a guy so fast unless she's met a celebrity or something. When you start the "W" phase, she will be ready for it.

Here, you will deliberately create voids in conversation and effect a drastic emotional shift in her mood.## WILLINGNESS TOOLS

1. "Why am I so into you now? This isn't supposed to happen like this. I'm not supposed to feel like this."
2. "You are my personal definition of trouble."
3. "How the hell are you doing this? I don't give a crap how goodlooking a woman is, I can resist anyone...I mean anyone. It takes a whole lot more than looks to impress me and I don't even know you well enough to know yet."
4. "Where did you grow up?" Keep asking questions that lead to sen-sory-rich explanations.
5. "When you were little, what did you want to be?" Feign rolling your eyes and then say, "I can't believe you just said that. This is too weird. Did one of my friends put you up to this?" Then, as you shake your head, slowly start to turn away from her.

## WILLINGNESS TOUCH HIERARCHY

1. Embracing with elongated eye contact and silence
2. Gentle hair pulling (back of the head)
3. Keeping your arm around her while talking to other people (break it off first)
4. A three-second shoulder massage. Tell her you're the best at them and stop after three seconds.5. Kissing. (Refer to the quick kiss guide.)

## O-PENNESS

This is a personality demonstration phase that allows you to grind a lot of your personality into her by way of stories and memories.

Demonstrating personality is crucial to the process. In this step, you will have an ACTUAL conversation. No woman wants a status robot. She needs a human being who LISTENS. Throughout the entire process of attraction, you will feel an irresistible urge to ask standard loser questions like, "What do you do?" "Where are you from?" etc. Don't do it. Act silly, play games, ask funny questions, or anything other than asking the standard questions. These are the questions she's heard from EVERY guy who has ever tried to sleep with her. When she hears them, it triggers a shocking automatic reaction in her mind. Just the words alone will remind her of all the losers who have approached her. Let me assure you that you WILL do this a few times out of a need to fill up a silence in conversation or lack of interesting topics. It's okay when you are in the beginningphase of learning, but it will naturally eliminate itself from your game as you develop the ability to run more solid and interesting conversation.

Also happening in this phase will be a stronger and more suggestive body language and touching. Hold her hand, look into her eyes for a few seconds without words, hold her close to you, but ALWAYS be the one to break contact first and say, "Whoa...this is scary. We totally need to slow this down. I'm enjoying this way too much. Ha-ha."

## OPENNESS TOOLS

1. "When I was a kid, my entire goal in life was to be a..." (tell your pre-created story)
2. "I'm kinda getting wierded-out now...(she'll ask why) Well, I feel like it's my birthday when I'm with you. You're becoming a drug for me and I might need to go to rehab now. We gotta slow this down. Who the hell are you that you can have this power over me? It feels weird."
3. "Did you ever make your own popsicles when you were growing up?" (Start childhood stories)
4. Continually change topics of conversation to establish a wider baseline. When you first meet her, very few things connect you.As you progress and change topics frequently, the base upon which your connection rests becomes significantly larger. The more you know about each other's genuine lives, the more she will feel connected to you.

## OPENNESS TOUCH HIERARCHY

1. Light kissing and embrace followed by a back off and more conversation.

## S-EDUCTION

Here, you will have tools for knowing what to do and say. You will play the role of the resistor here. Everything that girls normally do before they get to a bedroom, you will beat them to it.

This is where the process of the real cat and mouse game begins. Women are extremely similar when it comes to selecting a mate, but the closer they get to the bedroom, the more different they will seem. We will work with almost every possible situation here so you have all the tools you need for the job.

Obviously, you aren't in the club anymore. By now, you should be in a living room or someplace where a bedroom is only a few steps away.

The most important thing to remember is this: Do NOT let her be

---

member is this: Do NOT let her be the one to resist you. You must be the one to kiss her, gently grab the back of her hair and pull a little bit, look her right in the eye and tell her, "We need to slow down. I'm loving this too much." Until today, women were always resisting you. Not anymore.

You can laugh now. It feels good, doesn't it?

Once you both get back to your house, tell her she can only stay for a second, and then she has to go. You can actually tell her you're not going to sleep with her tonight. When she walks into your house, tell her your bedroom is OFF LIMITS for her because you don't want her to see it. If she's into you, this will drive her crazy having these boundaries around the bedroom that she can't break.

Okay, back to business. When you get back to your house, her house, or wherever you go, make sure you keep backing off and resisting her every time you kiss her. You can initiate the kiss, but you MUST be the one to say, "Hold on."

In this phase, you are basically doing everything that women usually do. The only difference is that you are beating them to the punch. Keep progressing with the touch hierarchy, but back off for a minute, then

---

THE PASSPORT

re-initiate and continue. Keep this process active all night to build anticipation: advance, advance, and back off.

SEDUCTION TOUCH HIERARCHY

1. Kissing
2. Tight embrace with eye contact
3. Hand-to-genital/breast contact (Briefly as if you just ran your hand over it)
4. Kissing her neck and shoulders
5. More deliberate genital contact

I-NTERACTION

Here you will demonstrate a willingness to not have sex at all. This will show her that you care about her and are not just after sex with her. You’ll share a very private story now, about something that really touched you. Don’t worry; there are plenty of samples to follow.

This step will take you into the last phase of the mating process: sex. Here you will demonstrate a need to be with her for other reasons than sex. She will feel safe, comfortable, and more open to you after this phase.

When things start to get hot, most guys will try to turn a woman on and get her really ready for sex.by kissing her harder, rubbing her more, or squeezing her harder, basically increasing the amount and intensity of things they are already doing. They think, It's time to have sex. I need to go faster and harder so she doesn't change her mind. This is horrible. Almost all women thrive sexually on anticipation and suspense. A true AMG knows how to build strong sexual tension, create throbbing anticipation, and stir her emotions before bringing them to boil.

While you are sitting on the couch, do something nonsexual like watch a movie, play a game, make a quick snack together, or roast marshmallows on a candle. Although it's nonsexual, remain close to her.

A woman has a biologically programmed fear of male abandonment following sex. A millennia ago, she would have risked her own life, as well as the lives of her offspring, if the male did not stay with her following a sexual encounter that caused a pregnancy. When you demonstrate a willingness and happiness to be with her with absolutely no sex at all, it tells her biological "sex alarm" to calm down. Doing this shows maturity, style, and a total sense of self-mastery. She understands here that you are com-fortable and satisfied not having sex, but just spending time with her.

When things start to heat up, back off. Tell her whatever reason you'd like to stop for a break, but this is a crucial step to showing her your level of independence and discipline.

## INTERACTION TOUCH HIERARCHY

There should be little to no touching, embracing, or anything in this phase.

## X-SEX

Use anticipation, build tension, increase tempo, back off a second, and repeat.

## DIRECT APPROACHING TECHNIQUES

Direct implies the immediate communication of your attraction to her and involves a very high level of confidence and playfulness.

1. "Hey, I'm not sure what it is, but I have a good feeling that you have a lot more going for you than beauty alone. I have to get going, but I'd like to chat. Do you have a cell phone?" When she pulls it out, simply tellher to put your number into it. When she does, tell her to hit send. You just got her number. This is a solid technique I've used for years and it will always work if she's single and your confidence and playfulness are aligned.
2. Walking by a girl, or group of girls, at a daytime place, stick your tongue out at her and make a mean-kid face that lets her know you are playing. When she does it back, walk over and tell her she's got a cute tongue, but it's too pink. Tell her you like her energy and it seems like she's got more going for her than her looks and get that number. If they don't stick their tongue out at you, you can still walk up and use a regular direct approach.
3. "Hey, I'm late for a gettogether with some friends and I've got to go, but what are you doing this Saturday at nine?" If she's free, proceed. If not, get her number with technique one and bail. "Awesome, I don't know what it is about you, but I really like the way you carry yourself. I mean, you're goodlooking, but it seems like you might have some good qualities beyond that. I can't put my fin-ger on it, but somehow it in- trigued me. My friends and I are going to (insert activity) and I'd like to get to know you more." Now get her number.

## WINGMAN 101

There are about six million ways to screw up an interaction with a wingman. Use your wingmen carefully, and follow the wingman guide when you are the wing.

1. Don't approach a group of girls together. One of you must go first for about two minutes, run solid material, and the wingman will enter stage left. As soon as the wingman comes into the interaction, immediately fill him in on the conversation and introduce him to the group. This eliminates the feeling women get when two guys approach two girls. It is completely obvious that the two of you are going to hit on them. Go in alone. Your wing should come in second.
2. If you or your wingman starts talking, even if you're interrupting the girls, turn to your wingman and LISTEN TO HIM. Your wingman should have tons more value and status to you than the girls. Most idiots are so excitedthat they are talking to girls that they will ignore their wingman and keep talking to the girls. STOP IT! Your wing is more important than ANY woman in the bar, and if he wants to talk over the girls or interrupt them, you must behave as if he's the only one speaking.
3. Brag about your wingman, but don't overdo it. As soon as he looks away or you have a second to speak to the girl he is going for, brag about him. "This guy is my best friend. He is the coolest guy in the world. Do you know who he is?" Building him up like a celebrity is something that will boost both of your status.
4. When you and your wing are not engaged in conversation with women, keep a solid, funny, excited conversation. Do not look around the bar for more interesting things or hot women. Your wing should be your focus point and whoever is speaking between the two of you should hold the attention of the other. When you look around the club/bar while your wing is talking, it kills his status. It tells everyone that he's not important enough to hold your attention, and it lowers your own status level as well.

---

5. Keep your wingman in the know. He should be informed of all of the lines you will use, the routines you have, and the methods you will use. The wingman will laugh at your jokes, assist you with games, and help you with stalls in the conversations.

6. The wingman is your savior, attraction mentor, and friend. He holds all of your cards and you should hold all of his. When you go into a group or make an approach, the wingman should be there to critique your body language tonality and the women's reactions. He should be able to identify your problem areas, help you work them out, and vice versa.

7. Have a signal when you want your wingman to help you or get you out of a group that you don't want to talk to anymore.

Dos and Don'ts:

Simple list of what to do instead of axe-murder attraction.

Don't—Live with passivity.

Do—Fully erase passivity from your life. Passivity is simply allowing things to happen as theyhappen without any action or planning on your part. This is a crucial piece to becoming the AMG. Get a planner and keep a schedule. Get a newspaper and make sure you know the entire goings on around town each day that you might want to go to. There might be gallery openings, races, support group meetings, ceremonies, small concerts, community events or something going on in your area you may want to go to. It also builds your status to know the goings on about your town. Keep the planner filled with things going on around town and use it as much as possible.

Don't- Smile too much while approaching or while talking to them.

Do- Smile because you are confident and you have something to smile about. Most guys who come to the classes smile while they are talking to women to show them that they mean no harm. Guys feel a very hard gut feeling going against making fun of a girl because of the social programming they went through. The result of this is a guy who tries to smile too much to convey innocence and try to convince her he was only joking in case she got pissed off.Don't- Let anyone or anything get you emotional.

Do- Be the person who is more in control of themselves than anyone else around. Women are attracted to the rock. Everyone wants to have a leader who they can trust to be calm and collected in an emergency. The AMG is the rock women can count on. This is as simple as thinking about it and making sure you are aware of your own emotional state so you can control it.

Don't- Use words like "yeah," "you know?" "right?" and "you see?"

Do- End your sentences where they should end. These words convey that you need confirmation from the other person to validate what you are saying. When you are confident, no one else needs to verify anything you say. You will need no confirmation or validation from anyone.

Don't- Fidget your hands or feet. Do- Keep still until you are ready to move. Fidgeting and fast movements indicate nervousness, anxiety, and worst of all, fear. Move your body in a fluid way, as if you were in a tub of jelly.

---

Don't - Brag about yourself...EVER!
Do- Talk up other people, and tell funny stories about yourself. Bragging only communicates one thing: You want people to think you are smart, cool, or whatever because you say so, not because you actually are. If you are all those things, they will show through.

Don't- Approach with "hey, ladies," or "hey, girls."

Do- Use "hey, guys," or just plain "hey." Saying ladies or girls conveys creepy signals. It means you are looking at them as women and you will relate to them that way. They will want to get rid of you quickly.

Don't- Walk directly up to women and face them.

Do- Walk almost past them, and do your first ten seconds of communication over your shoulder. Let them know you have to get going soon and keep your feet in the position as if you were about to keep walking. Try this exercise: Get a friend and stand facing him, four inches from his nose. It's uncomfortable. Now, stand four inches away, but beside him, looking in the same directionhe is. It's more comfortable and less confrontational to not face them immediately.

Don't- Talk too fast.
Do- Slow down your speech. People who speak too fast are usually doing it to avoid being interrupted. Don't be afraid to pause for effect, or when you can't think of a word. People will wait for you to finish. But don't use this to be rude, or you'll get cut off. Make it part of your daily calm demeanor.

Don't- Buy women drinks.
Do- Tell them they are more than welcome to buy you one. (In a cocky tone while smiling) If they persist on getting you to buy a drink, you need to put your foot down. Refuse to buy them drinks. If you are going to hang with them, this behavior will not be tolerated. You have to set boundaries immediately or you'll be invaded.
Don't- Try to compliment women to make them like you.

Do- Make fun of them. Never make fun of a woman in a mean or rude way. Do it the same way thirdgraders would do on a playground:Call her a dork, nerd, closet geek, pimp, man-hater, Dalai Lama etc. If she's really skinny, tell her she looks like your favorite linebacker, in a cocky, but joking way. Don't be serious about this. If she's dressed to kill, make sure you tell her that all the women are buying that same dress these days, but you still like it. These are compliments in a way. You will call her all of these names and make fun of her, but in a way to suggest you like that quality about her.

Women in bars automatically expect to get hit on a lot. This makes them feel like they own the place. All you are doing is bringing them to your level and letting them know you like them, but they aren't fooling you at all.

Don't- Look around the room while your friends are talking to you.

Do- Make sure you pay attention to your friends. When you see people looking around the room, they are usually looking for something more entertaining that what's in front of them. You will kill your chances by doing this. Make sure that your conversation looks interesting and fun. No one in your group should be staring off into the bar looking for hotties.

---

Don't - Walk up to girls from behind.

Do - Make sure they can see you. Walking up from behind is a little creepy and weirds women out. Everything is casual. Over your shoulder is the best way to do this...it's the best way to do all of your approaches.

Don't - Hover over or stare at a group of women.

Do - Approach and start immediately if they are close. Staying too close to a group of girls will make them uncomfortable. Yes, they know you're looking at them.

Don't - Try to lean in to a woman if you can't hear her in a bar.

Do - Tell her you can't hear her and let her either stand up, or move closer to you. The urge to lean in is very hard to break, and it will take some practice.

Be the Life of the Party at Clubs

Look across a room of people. There's usually one guy who seems to be the center of the party. This is a great technique that Bill

---

Clinton used to do when he was running for governor; it's called "fusing a room."

When you are in a club, bar, or even a restaurant, you have the very unique ability to join two groups of people you've never met together. Once you meet a group of women, or men (yes, you should be talking to men as well to build your status), you can introduce them to a new group by way of a new approach question, or by finding a similarity between the two. Introduce everyone to everyone.

Formula: Meet someone new, introduce them to other people you don't know...repeat.

The Three-Minute Phone Number Technique

This should be used mostly in the daytime and in venues where it is quiet enough for you to use a fast approach and immediately show your interest in the girl.

Simply use the same body language and intro you normally would: facing the direction in which you were already moving, and letting her know you have somewhere to be.

As soon as you've done this, you can communicate your interest in her. This is especially useful when you actually have very little time and you want to grab her number

---

quickly. This has been a tested and proven method to work for you consistently and return positive results.

As soon as you tell her you have to be somewhere, say, "I noticed you over here (doing whatever she's doing) and I'm not too sure what it is about you, but it really seems like you have a lot more going for you than just your looks, and I wanted to meet you." Make sure you still have your confident smile and easy-going body language.

Now, slowly turn your body toward her and use an opening line and very quick story from the toolkit to demonstrate a little bit of cool-guy personality to her. As you do this, she will warm up to you and right when she starts to get hooked into a conversation, you tell her you've got to go and say, "It seems like you've got a pretty cool energy. I like that. It was cool meeting you." Either shake her hand or give her the fist pound and walk away.

As soon as you are about two or three steps away, turn around while saying, "Hey," in a confident tone. As soon as she looks at you, have your cell phone in your hand and as you stick it out to give it to her, say, "I'm going to be late, but you have a cell phone, right?"

---

Most of the time, she will take the phone from you and start to punch her number in there. But when she takes your phone and looks at it, just jokingly say, "You're not a stalker, are you?" Try to avoid the use of the word "phone" as it might invoke a response to the hundreds of other guys who tried to get her number and acted like morons. Tell her to type her cell in there, when she needs the prompting.

You can alter or change this as much as you want to. The important thing is the structure of the interaction. You must be confident, funny, and authoritative. She needs to feel a sense of loss as you start to walk away so that she will respond more positively when you try to get her number.

Of course, there are about a hundred variables here and no one can predict the outcome of a fluid human interaction, but you CAN decide how you will make her feel about you.

I have a completely authoritative and dominant friend who insists on just walking up to women and handing them his cell phone, but I would recommend that you at least begin with the technique first. Once you reach a level where you are so confident that nothing

---

matters and you have eliminated all of your approach fears, this might work for you, but stick to the material to begin with.

Note: One good technique a friend uses when he is able to learn her name before he goes for the number is to get the number entry screen on his cell phone ready with her name on it before he hands her the phone. This is great when you are getting numbers of employees at restaurants, stores, etc., where they wear name tags.

Eliminating Fear on the Approach
Every man gets nervous when he approaches hot women. It is universal, but the amount of fear and anxiety each man has on the walk-up is different. The only true way to get rid of it and make yourself into a machine that gets unbelievable results that your friends will think you are a god for is to expose yourself to the situation.

When you first start approaching women, the fear will feel something like standing at the edge of a cliff. Your stomach will churn, your heart will pound, and your hand might even shake. I've seen it all. Trust me, you are NOT alone. Once you are able to do this a couple hundred times, it will feel like brushing your teeth...no big deal.Approach and start conversations with women everywhere. Approach at the store, mall, coffee shop, bookstore, restaurant, bar, club, gym, school, and street. Work on your approach at every opportunity. You don't have to try to get numbers from every single woman you see, just walk up and start a quick conversation with one of the appetizers in the toolkit, tell a quick story, and bail if you want to. The more you do this, the better and more natural you will feel when you approach a woman you want to date. I don't care if the woman is fat, bald, too tall, too short, or whatever; you need to work on your skills and practice all of your body language and routines.

If you've ever watched the TV series Psych on the USA network, you have seen a perfect example of how to deal with tests, and be humorous and unique at the same time. The lead character in the show demonstrates hundreds of body language, social, and psychological techniques worth duplicating in each episode. Go buy the seasons, or watch it however you can. It will definitely spark a few ideas for your approaches.

The best guys have become the best because they have been able to go out and try all kinds of newthings over and over until they became so good that not even a gorgeous woman was able to slow down their game. This needs to be you.

If you find in the middle of an approach that a boyfriend walks up or something, immediately communicate that you are not into her at all. Start talking about your boyfriend, or your wife, and you'll be fine.

Is it easier to approach an unattractive woman? Why? Because you have no intention of sleeping with her, and if she rejects you or says anything stupid, you had no interest in the first place, so you would be able to laugh it off. The only difference in this woman and the dream girl is the intent in your head. You will actually be able to FEEL a change when you begin approaching and you have a pretty fair amount of them accomplished. The transformation process is what this is all about.

Become a social butterfly on purpose.

## Quick-Kiss Techniques

Using the touch hierarchy is the most important thing you can do to be able to get the kiss when you want it. It IS possible to kiss herafter a few minutes. When you feel that feeling in the pit of your stomach that makes you nervous whether or not you should kiss her...it's time to kiss her. There are a few good ways to do this.

1. "You rock, did you know that? You have a cool personality, a fun attitude and, well...I'm not sure what else yet. (Let her reply) There's only one other thing I need to know about you...are you a good kisser?" (Kiss her)
2. "Did you ever play truth or dare when you were young? I once did it and this girl named Stacie kissed me and just covered my face in saliva. It was so gross. Everyone made fun of her, but I tried to defend her. It was no use. You don't kiss like that, do you? Good." (Kiss her)
3. "Hey...come over here so I can kiss you"
4. "Alright, I want to get this on camera." Hold out camera and take a picture of the two of you together. Tell her she was making a weird face in the picture and try again. If the second one is good, tell her you're going to get your official first kiss on camera. Hold up the camera or give it to a bystander and don't look into her eyes deeply untilRIGHT before you kiss her. This is a very romantic and cool technique that almost always works.
5. "Okay, on a one-to-ten scale, how good of a kisser are you?" Whatever she says, be surprised about it. (Kiss her)

## Value/Status Builder Kit

Value is nothing like it seems. I define it as the amount of effort someone will go through to ensure your comfort levels are adequate. It's not the same as status, which is defined in a group of people. Value is something you carry inside WHEREVER you go. Here are a few ways to add value to your current game.

1. Qualify people: Ask questions and get guys and girls to brag about themselves. It forces a situation where they are trying to impress you.
2. Give value: Don't try to take it from someone. If you look at a photo of a guy and a hot girl in a bar, the guy will usually be leaning into the woman, boosting his value by being with her. You can be the one to give value to others, by building them up, reassuring them that they don't

---

have to impress you, and that they are cool to hang around with.
3. When a girl is talking to you (no matter how hot she is), move your leg and body as if you were going to walk away, hold it there for a second, and then come back to her. Act almost as if you are trying to see something or someone who is far away and you need to take a step in that direction to get a little closer. You will be shocked at the reaction you get.
4. Be loud and confident.

# Body Language Tricks 

Using body language is just as powerful as using words. You can change the way people react before you even speak to them. Here are a few tricks to help you build value and status nonverbally. You'll see some of these in the 55 Laws of the Alpha Male section as well.

1. Slow down your body language! If nothing else, this is what you should do.
2. Keep your shoulders back. When you do this, relax them. When your posture is very good and confident, you'll notice that your shoulders will naturally

---

go back.
3. Make very strong and deliberate eye contact. You should NOT make mean, threatening, or "tough" facial expressions. Smile! Have a facial expression that communicates confidence, and a love for other people.
4. Neck should be aligned with the back. You can have very good posture and still be very comfortable. Remember that your spine ends at the back of your head.
5. Lean back when you listen; others will lean in to you.
6. Relax your eyelids. This is visible from across a room.
7. Hold your drink to your side; let your arm relax.
8. Spread your feet out about shoulder width apart. Don't get squeezed in. Own your space around you. It's yours and you should occupy it.
9. Smile. This is simple and effective. Just a hint of a smile can convey so much.
10. Take full breaths. Most guys will breathe shallow breaths when they feel threatened or they feel like their personal space is too small. Breathe through your abdomen, not your chest.
11. Keep your eyes still. Don't bescanning the room for better things or cooler people. You need to know that the party is right here...inside you. Looking around the room only shows you are bored, or looking for important people in the room. Looking around like this while a guy or girl is talking to you is a solid way to boost status.
12. Avoid hygienic gestures in public such as fixing hair, licking lips, adjusting clothing, looking down at your outfit, and looking into mirrors as you pass by them.
13. Keep all of your arm movement while speaking even with or below your chest line.
14. Remember that no matter how much you "fake" body language, your internal state of mind will leak through and be visible. Women are certifiable experts at reading body language. You must be internally sound for all of your body language to come through looking tight. This is why a man whose life is together and who "handles his business" has great body language because he knows that everything is going his way and he created that reality.
15. Do not be afraid to physically move women in front of you so you can talk to them. Grab them

---

and use a focus line immediately. Reach out confidently as she walks by and start talking immediately. Don't hold her arm longer than is necessary to get her in front of you. Use only minimal physical pressure, but don't come off as a pansy. Imagine a gorgeous woman walking by you as you are talking to your wingman. As she walks by, you reach out, grab her at her lower bicep and start talking as if you do this ALL the time. The only difference between guys who can do this and guys who can't is the belief that it is okay to do it. If it comes natural as a result of who you are, then it will be communicated in your body language.
16. When crossing/folding your arms, instead of folding them regularly, flatten your hands so that your palms are touching your chest and your thumbs are pointing directly upward. This is a huge confidence signal.

# Women Conversation Tricks 

Contrary to what some might say, bragging about how many cores your CPU has, how fast you can download porn, or how much turbo PSI you'repushing through your old riced-up Honda will not get you anything but a blank stare at best. Women respond to vivid, adjective-rich descriptions, emotional content, and controversial relationship topics. They don't care if you're a level50 goblin warrior with wizard powers. No, seriously, they don't. (I've had a ton of students and I've heard every line in the book. You might not believe how frequently these things come up.)

The art of good storytelling will take you a long way. Women have reported being more attracted to men who demonstrate an ability to tell stories well and use humor.

In the world of stand-up comedy and infomercials, they use a technique known as "pull-off" to leave you hanging on one subject while they begin talking about another. So in the middle of a story, you can begin another story and leave them in suspense until you decide to get back to it. It will work to hold attention of groups and women in bars and clubs especially.

When you tell a story, use vivid descriptions. Use your body to tell the story and don't be afraid to do something stupid. Again, Dane Cook is a perfect example of this.

When you are talking to a group or a single girl, the most impor-

---

tant thing to remember is that she will only be as attracted to you as you expect her to be. It must be totally natural for you that women swoon over you all day long, and the fact that she does it is no big deal.

A story from your life should involve humor, adventure, and emotion. Use the samples until you can create your own or re-visit some of your own experiences to make them sharpened tools of mass seduction.

# Giving Validation 

When you compliment someone on something completely unique and valid, it will be appreciated. No matter how much she's into you, she will eat up one or two (no more) compliments about something completely unique about her.

You boost her value just by being around her. A woman, or anyone for that matter, will respond to you as soon as they realize you are on a different level. If you just found out that you won ten million dollars and you walked into a club, you wouldn't give a shit about anything else. Only your own good time would matter and not even a hot girl can make you think otherwise. It would be the happiest day ofyour life, and if someone tried to pull you down, all you would do is laugh. This is how successful players establish social dominance and people feel good around them.

Human beings are naturally attracted to others who are positive and don't look sad or depressed. When they are in the presence of someone in a kick-ass, awesome mood, they begin to feel it themselves. Positive and fun attitudes are viral and contagious.

Be the center. Have the MOST fun. Be the HAPPIEST guy and don't worry about what anyone else thinks. If you are only in the bar or club to have fun, there is no possible negative outcome that any woman can give you. All of them will receive validation and happiness just from being around you.

## On the Phone With Her

Once you develop the ability to get lots of numbers whenever and wherever you want, you will have women who won't call you back, girls who won't answer the phone, and worse. When you make a call, there are a few things you must do to ensure she keeps highlevel interest. We'll cover this in two sections: when she picks up and when she doesn't1. Eat chips, cheese balls, or whatever you fancy when you talk to her. The sound alone will be enough to show her how comfortable and confident you are.
2. If you get her voice mail and it's the first time you've called, say something like, "Get this, I just saw a humongous, fat clown like three seconds ago driving this pimped-out Mercedes Benz. The guy was completely dressed up and had one of those frowns painted on his face. When I pulled up next to him at the light, he looked over at me and I thought I was going to pee on myself...wait, I might have. Hold on...okay, we're good. Oh yeah, it's Chase. Call me back."
3. If you've already had contact and have spoken a few times over the phone and you get her voice mail, create a trap. Say, "Hey, Stacie, It's Chase. I was just eating one of those huge burritos with French fries in them and it made me think of you." She will be completely taken off guard and will want to know why you thought of her when you were eating a "huge" burrito.
4. If you have called a few times and keep getting voice mail, consider it a loss and have fun with it. Call her voice mail andsay, "Stacie, it's Chase. I was just thinking about you and how much I can't live without you." (In a joking tone of voice) "I just wanted to sing you a quick song 'cause I miss you so much." Then bust out a love song on her voice mail. Not a whole one, but one you're sure she knows. Then say, "Straight up...call me back, G." Do this whole voice mail in a very joking tone, but sing like you are completely miserable that she won't call you back. If she doesn't, you will have had fun.
5. When you get her on the phone and she answers, make sure you have a story ready to go, and a few observations about her. Don't call unless you know what you are going to say. When she answers the phone, start off with a quick story and ask her what she's up to. Keep the conversation short and tell her you have to get going somewhere. Always be the first one to say you have to go on the phone.
6. While you are on the phone with her, the game doesn't stop. You should still be playing jokes, busting on her, and joking around. Make her say over and out, tell her you guys are going to use secret codenames for each

---

other when you call her from now on, make her try to freestyle rap on the phone, ask her about interesting vacations she's been on. Just keep the sexual tension going and keep it playful.

7. When she wants to have a serious conversation about something, don't be too eager to make it into a game. Know when she needs a minute for you to LISTEN and be there for her. Being funny and cocky is cool, but you have to know when to be an adult with her when she needs it.

8. If she answers the phone and sounds weird, ask if it's your breath.

9. Beatbox...nuff said.

Games to Play

Anything you did in the fourth grade is gold. Women love games and childish, fun things that remind them of childhood. To most women, there is nothing more attractive than a man who is completely confident and mature, with strong leadership skills, and who can completely let go and play childish games he played in elementary school.

1. Thumb wrestling: an American classic2. Hand butt (Where you put your hands together and spread your fingers and make her do the same. When you interlock hands down the middle and tell her to open hers and look inside, it will look like a bodily orifice.)
3. Sketching a crappy picture of each other on napkins or whatever
4. Tic-tac-toe
5. The quick-slap hand game (don't hit her hard...duh)
6. Use the environment; read body language of other people together
7. Fake palm reading
8. Have her make up a magic trick and make fun of her.
9. Do a mock puppet show of you and her with your hands. Make her voice sound really girlie and stupid. Make her (your hand) keep trying to make out with you. (You can also make her pull out her phone and use both of your phones as puppets.)
10. Make up code names for each other. Tell her you are going to be secret agents for the night and you have to have secret code names that she has to promise never to repeat to anyone. Make her pinky swear. (Touch hierarchy)11. Coolest Pet Name Game: Announce to the group that you're going to play this game. Go around the table and find out everyone's pet's names and appoint yourself as the judge.
12. The timeless, classic "highfive"
13. Bring a marker and write your names on a wall together.

## Role-Playing

Women love playing games. There is a lot of power in making up a new game where the two of you are the only ones involved and she is required to assume a different role in order to participate.

1. Code names (make up secret agent code names for each other).
2. Cell phone puppet show (use both of your cell phones and do a puppet show of you and her where she is really annoying and bratty).
3. Make up a secret handshake and make her promise to remember it for next time you see her. Practice it with her.
4. Ask her about all the weird guys who approach her with lame-ass lines and have her demonstrate it. Make her walk like ten feet away and approach you as if you

---

were a woman. Laugh at her performance.
5. Tell her to go up to a nerdy guy and ask him if he has any drugs.
6. Have her act like she's an abusive girlfriend of yours and see if anyone steps in to see if you are okay.
7. Pretend you are a news interviewer on a TV show and use a pen or straw for a mic. Interview her and keep it going for only a few minutes.

# Dominance 

1. You must be able to project your voice slightly louder than the environment you are in.
2. Encourage other men to get girls. Don't be afraid to tell some guy that he would be perfect for your girl. She will know you are joking, and he will feel a little weird.
3. Demonstrate leadership. Be the first one to take her hand and lead her or the group to a different place in the bar. Be the one to suggest going to another place together. (When you leave a bar together and go into another one together, she will stay with you because you came there together. The same principle ap-plies to when you move a group within a bar and find a spot or a table together.)
4. Be more comfortable and relaxed than anyone around you. Show the LEAST signs of having any anxiety or nervousness.
5. Don't be afraid to touch people kindly, make friendly and strong eye contact, and smile. Be genuinely interested in people and ask questions. When you do this to guys, it's completely disarming. You can get another guy to start bragging about himself and talking about his job really quickly. Act interested and impressed when they do this. You will score points with all the women if you can hold awesome conversations with guys and they see you touching them and being a leader.
6. When someone is talking, turn your body away from him or her briefly, and then turn back to them. It will demonstrate a carefree and dominant (not domineering) attitude.

## THE 55 LAWS OF THE ALPHA MALE GENTLEMAN:

1. Always take up a lot of space. Beta males always shrink up asif they were apologizing for the invasion of other people's space. Be territorial. Claim it because you own it.
2. Be calmer than everyone around you. Stress (talking about it or showing it) is an indicator of beta-male status. Be unaffected by what others are affected by. Heat, sweat, cold, stress, etc... Leaders are aloof and confident. Stop complaining. It screams powerlessness and weakness.
3. Slow down body movements and visualize moving underwater. Relax your eyelids.
4. Resist the fear that you will piss people off. Be willing to be distracted when someone is talking to you. Be willing to take the lead and end the conversation when you want to. You should be the initiator for most conversations, too.
5. STOP trying to please everyone and make him or her like you. Start qualifying everyone and don't give any fake smiles, laughs, or gestures until they EARN IT!
6. Develop a sense of impudence: Take liberties you know you deserve.
7. Know your own worth. When someone does you a favor or gives you something, don't over-appreciate it. Know that you deserved it and you had it coming from them. Act as though it is expected when people help, do favors, and give things to you. Set boundaries and limitations on what you will tolerate from others.
8. Confidence: This is simply freedom from self-doubt, and having strong beliefs in your own actions, words, and abilities. Don't overanalyze this.
9. Be supportive of "lesser" males. Aggression is never a good idea. Use praise instead. Make sure your friends are safe and they see you ensuring their safety.
10. Smile less often. It doesn't make you rude, just discerning. People should earn your smiles and laughs. Give them as rewards when people win you over.
11. Don't EVER act apologetic. Don't use excuses or feel the need to explain your actions...EVER!
12. Keep your life in order and maintain fun and discipline within it. Time with you is valuable and rare...you are busy and focused on yourself.
13. Frame equals mood + beliefs about the current situation. Don't get sucked into anyone's mood. Pull them into yours, forcefully. Be the pillar ofstrength that is unmovable. Why do you think strippers like those poles so much?
14. If you don't define the meaning of the interaction, the other person will do it for you.
15. Remain silent every once in a while after someone finishes talking. Look at them and wait...they will keep talking to make you happy.
16. Speak slowly. You will NOT lose the group's attention.
17. Every once in a while, choose a time for you when you will be closed off for the day. Just stand in quiet confidence and be as silent as possible. People will try to get you to talk and wonder what's up.
18. Don't ever laugh at your own jokes. This kills!
19. Make statements whenever possible. People should have to earn your questions.
20. Don't look around at other people, trying to get energy or attention from them. Your energy is within you. Be in your own universe; you can have a welcome mat, but others should still be a guest.
21. Hold everyone's attention. If they look away or get distracted, be the first to walk away, get even more distracted, or become immediately busy.22. ELIMINATE the fear of being the one to break a group's state by taking the lead and beginning or ending something first so that others will follow.
23. Make yourself COMFORTABLE. Don't be uncomfortable when speaking to others or groups. Face the direction you feel like facing.
24. Make strong eye contact. You don't have to have a serious face on when you do this. That's stupid. Smirk a tiny bit like you know more than they do.
25. Don't try to make people like you.
26. At the first sign of people's indecision, be the FIRST to speak up and take action.
27. Don't wait to take control. Seize the opportunity.
28. Out-alpha the AMGS by shoulder taps, friendly elbows, compliments, and putting social pressure on him. Social pressure is only using a psychological spotlight.
29. When a competing male tries to challenge you or take control of the group, ignore him, don't make eye contact, and keep your body posture. (Shoulders back and relaxed, head back, smile a little.) Comment when he's finished.
30. Be comfortable having completecontrol of the group. It is a responsibility you must take on. Don't be afraid that you will screw things up.
31. With men: Start qualifying immediately. As soon as you get them to qualify, compliment them on something and start telling a story before they can respond.
32. Being in control is simple: It is only about believing fully in what you are doing. Believe that you have the best plan of action and no one could possibly do better.
33. If someone says something you don't like, SMILE, roll your eyes a little, and give them a look as if they were a cute little kid.
34. You must be the one who expends the least amount of nervous energy. You will then be in control. Let others get nervous, wondering if they are impressing you or not.
35. Be talkative: Say whatever is on your mind and don't worry about the consequences. Just be a talkative person.
36. Don't be afraid to make others feel bad. If you feel you need to say something, say it. Don't ever try to camouflage your intent. Be honest and direct. This will earn you all kinds of respect points.

---

37. Resist the need to share the intensity of emotions you're feeling.
38. Touch people when you talk to them. Know that it's okay to do.
39. Don't pause too long when someone asks you a question. This indicates your deep thinking about the question and your need to give them the best possible answer...stop dong this!
40. Steeple your hands when you speak if you feel like you are getting a little nervous. This shows LOTS of confidence and is a leader indicator.
41. Don't walk too fast. This is another behavior that is used to break your own frame. Slow down and relax. Know you are the MAN.
42. Straighten your spine, tilt your pelvis forward, relax, and spread out. Take up space...it's YOURS!!
43. Don't always respond when someone calls your name. When you do respond, turn your head to them slowly.
44. Keep it short and to the point. Don't go into some elaborate and boring story. (I know you love it, but it's boring.)
45. When you ask advice from other people, let them have the spotlight. Don't be afraid to let someone else stand in the spot-light for a while. Compliment them when they do.
46. Never stop someone from performing acts of generosity toward you, or be too thankful when they do.
47. Be dominant and in control. If you don't like the conversation...walk away. Start talking to someone else in the middle of the conversation if you feel like it. You are the alpha and you are in charge. Regardless of income, rank etc...you are the leader.
48. Don't ever brag about yourself. Not bragging builds mystery. Let them discover things on their own.
49. Don't EVER put yourself down! Alpha males do not do this unless it is an OBVIOUS joke! It's okay to make a joke to convey the opposite of what you are saying in the joke.
50. Don't ever put others down or talk badly about someone else!!! This is key. When you put others down, it reveals your own insecurities. If they are no threat, don't act like they are. Women will take up sides with anyone you decide to put down.
51. Live a life of DISCIPLINE AND FUN: the two secret ingredients in the alpha male's life.

---

52. If you treat people like they are cooler than you are, you are a beta male.
53. You must always be more willing to accept not having sex than she is. It must be completely fine with you that you aren't having sex.
54. Use clean language unless you really have to curse. Profanity is just like verbal violence: The people who use it are usually totally insecure and frightened by their lack of dominance.
55. Use violence as a LAST resort. The pack leader of any pack is not a bully.

Qualities of the HUNTER:

- Ability to withstand sharp pain (exercise and experiences)
- Proper nutrition (the alpha eats first and gets the best parts)
- Endurance (able to catch prey; in modern times this is emotional endurance)
- Social relaxation (Conserving energy for the hunt)
- Ability to reflexively respond to aggressors (conveyed through stories)
- Calculated thought patterns (able to plan in advance and have goals)- Goal-oriented (Prey drive and quick decision-making skills)
- Motivated toward reward, not away from negative consequences
- Motivated to protect peers and assist them in their success/hunting
- Physical strength and power (communicated through body language alone)
- Strong eye contact with other males (this doesn't mean staring a guy down; it means smiling and being confident)
- Intelligence (does not outwardly display it or brag)
- Ability to adapt to different environments quickly (socially, of course)
- Evolved and tandem use of ALL sensory systems

Qualities of the LEADER:

- Initiative (be the one who suggests the first idea and the first activity, and always plan ahead for contingencies)
- Immediately and politely establishes his rank
- Ability to show both correction and caring simultaneously
- Commitment (to his peers' and his subordinates' success)
- Courage (ability to be the dominant, aggressive male to## protect others)

- Goal-oriented (setting goals in very short- and long-term venues)
- Generosity (sharing with lesser males and giving helpful advice when needed)

Become a better "animal." We are all animals. Every single person has the ability to enforce his or her rank as the pack leader. Make it your new favorite position and keep it there. These qualities are the ONLY things women's unconscious minds are triggered to respond to. Don't ever fall into the trap of thinking that once you get a woman, you should "relax" and let all of this go. This is a life-long commitment and should be taken seriously. I know that only about ten percent of the people reading this will actually take this to heart, so to that ten percent, congrats.

## One-Liners

Meant to be delivered in a semicocky and mostly teasing/playful tone: 1. How much would it take for you to...? (Say something like walk around the club and tell every one that you are a pineapple princess or go ask a group of people a crazy question.)

---

2. Which female actress would you most like to beat up?
3. We're both going to dress up as pirates next time we go out, but you have to be the evil one 'cause you look like you cause lots of trouble anyway...
4. I bet you kick ass at Star Trek trivia...you look like a trekkie.
5. We are so going to fight later and I'm going to win. Then I'm going to sit on you...and maybe I'll fart.
6. You better watch it...I've been working on my karate chop. (Do a totally lame and funny karate chop, but keep a straight face like she's supposed to be really impressed.)
7. We're going to make up a cool nickname for you. (Create a funny, nonsexual, and non-female nickname for her, i.e. Snoopy, Ketchup eater...something completely off the wall that makes YOU smile.)
8. Are you a drug dealer?
9. "My mom would SOOO not approve of you. You are t-r-o-u-b-le...did I spell that right?"
10. If you ever come out with me, I'm wearing a fake mustache!
11. You're not really my type, but I'd bet you'd be an awesome shopping buddy. You could pick out all my outfits and stuff.How good are you at fashion?
12. If you were a lesbian, would you convert for George Clooney?
13. You know that you and I would never get along...and I would win all the fights, too!
14. If she asks where you are from, tell her you were cryogenically frozen and you're actually from the sixties. Start using words like groovy and hip.
15. Tell her you are from Saturn and you are just visiting before you go back to Moon Base Bravo.
16. Tell her you are from the future and you have come back in time to stop yourself from meeting her tonight.
17. Make her steal a saltshaker or something for you. Tell her to put it into her purse and you will write both of your names on it later as a memento. (Anything small you can remember together that also is an inside joke is a huge thing to women. Keep matchbooks from restaurants, bar coasters that you make her write on or sign etc. She will melt when she finds out you kept them.)

## Dealing With Other Guys

It's going to happen eventually. Most guys are very insecure andwill become angry when they see you talking to a girl they know. This is very easy to deal with if you know how to judge the situation.

If you are in conversation already and he comes out of nowhere and puts his arm around her or makes obvious gestures that he is with her, use an approach line on him and ask them how long they have been together. Congratulate them on being a cute couple and bail.

If you aren't sure if he's with her, but he comes in the conversation and starts trying to make fun of you or tell you to go away, simply tell him there's nothing to worry about because you are gay. The guy will believe you, but women are extremely intuitive and she will know you aren't.

If you see a girl you want, and she's with a group that has guys in it, there's a simple and easy way to find out who is who. Approach the whole group like you would a normal group of girls. Just treat the guys like girls you aren't interested in. There really is no difference when it comes to guys being there or not. Run a quick approach and throw a story out. After the story, ask everyone at the table if they are all co-workers. This will usually stir up a few introductions and allow you to find

---

out the relationship of your girl to the people at the table.

When a guy is talking to you and you want him to be a little uneasy, you can either keep a straight and interested face while reaching all the way into your pants to massage and scratch yourself, OR you can stare at his forehead while he speaks. These work equally great.

Another killer technique is to be genuinely interested in a guy and ask him a question about himself that you know he will like responding to. As soon as the first sound comes out of his mouth, turn away and IMMEDIATELY start talking to someone else about the club, party etc.

Don't EVER be afraid or embarrassed to act gay or completely back out of a fight if your safety is at risk. When guys fight over girls, it only shows the belief that you think you may never get another one. Don't be stupid.

Wardrobe

What you wear is important on occasion. While wearing old gym shorts and a t-shirt from high school is cool sometimes, it's not for the normal nightlife outing. We'll get into the specifics on

---

that. I deliberately made this chapter very short because there are so many good resources out there for this.

When dressing up, there's no need to tuck your shirt in unless you are wearing a suit jacket with your outfit. You can wear a dress shirt untucked, but make sure it is designed to be worn that way. People at any clothing store can show you this.

Belt and shoes should be the same color. Black and brown don't go well together, and women WILL notice if you do this.

When you go out to bars, dinner, and such, you should dress well. While it can actually benefit you to wear old, faded (clean) clothes, you should use it in moderation. When going to the mall or something, it is a demonstration of disinterest and communicates you are not trying to impress anyone. This works in your favor provided the clothes, and you, are clean.

A simple pair of modern slacks and a dress shirt with the top two buttons (no more) unbuttoned is acceptable. Don't wear anything with pleats. They are way out of style and the fashion police will shoot you on sight if they catch you. Just don't do it.Get rid of:
Pull-over strap shoes with the hook and loop stuff
pleated pants and shorts
The 1980s river sandals (wear some nice flip flops instead)
Socks and undershirts that have changed color
Large gold necklaces
Don't wear undershirts when you have a dress shirt unbuttoned. Show your chest, and if it's hairy, wax it.
Conversation piece clothing:
It's cool to wear pieces of clothing or jewelry that attract attention, but DON'T do it. If you do, you will look like a clown. A guitar-pick necklace, funny cufflinks, a weird watch, aloha shirts, and even a little eyeliner are all fine. Eyeliner has been used with awesome success over the years, and even guys dressed in suits have worn it and received lots of atten* tion.

## Your House

You don' t have to have a five-million-dollar house with expensive furniture to take home even the richest model in sight. It doesn't work that way. Having stuff awry in your house can sometimes help you.only because women sometimes see men as little projects and look for your potential instead of your actual condition.

If your house is clean, organized, and stylish, you are halfway there.

## LIVING ROOM

- Have candles, blankets, and movies ready for nighttime.
- Keep your couch clean and smelling good.
- Make sure your blankets are clean.
- Have a few movies to choose from, but make sure you are the one who chooses one.
- Take down any and all posters that aren't in a frame.
- Put some curtains up on windows to build a sense of privacy when you bring her home.
- Leave out a few things that are interesting to look at and demonstrate your personality like cool books (not this one), art, something from one of your hobbies-something she will want to pick up and ask you about.
- Have a wine rack or something like it ready for drinks in the living room.
- Put out candles but don'toverdo it (make sure you have matches).

- Have music ready to go, but don't make it obvious you were expecting to bring her home (i.e. hooking the clapper thing up to the CD player that plays "Let's Get It On").


## Your Bedroom and Bathroom

Think about one word: CLEAN

1. Bleach your tub. Yes, I know your tub has a ring around it.
2. Clean off countertops and medicine cabinets. She will snoop.
3. Keep soap and towels ready for use and organized.
4. Keep a list of things you are doing in your life up on the mirror; she will read it.
5. Keep interesting and unique magazines or short books by the toilet.
6. Sheets, pillows, and comforter should be clean and the bed made.
7. Keep cool books on the bedside table.
8. Leave clean and clutter-free horizontal spaces in the room (bookshelves, tables, nightstands, etc.).
9. Have one framed picture in the bathroom and at least three in the bedroom.10. Make sure the bedroom smells nice and not from a bunch of cologne covering up your gym laundry that's been there for two weeks.
11. Put a few candles on the tables and bookshelves and keep one on the bedside table.
12. Have things ready in your room or living room for the interaction process.

## Online Dating

The same exact techniques you might use in the bar or bookstore can also be used while you are online. The difference is that you can't "approach" a woman online and do a set of body language and verbal tricks to build the initial attraction momentum and make her interested in you. This is where your "profile" comes into play.

Every profile you see from guys online is the same; they talk very little about what they want in a woman and instead, brag about themselves and try to list reasons women should like them. They display a barrage of boring, shirtless, and beer bottle-littered pictures that are supposed to show how cool they are. This is a good thing because you will be able to standout a lot more once you read this.
The Internet has become an increasingly popular place to meet girls. From dating websites to hookup havens, it's still easy. No matter where you are trying to meet women, the principles stay the same. Once you can communicate that you are the one CHOOSING them, it becomes easy.

The best way to reverse the chasing roles online is to look at a bunch of women's profiles and take the good stuff from them. Steal their beliefs. Women will have a mile-long list of all the qualities they want in a man and a list of disqualifiers that tell men whether or not they are good enough for them. It's completely insane and all you have to do is take their mentality from them. Bring the screening process and fun onto your profile. If you scan a hundred women's profiles, you'll see a word that most of them have in common: "FUN." Women are completely wrapped around this word online.

When you design your profile, keep the mystery alive; don't give out your stats like you're writing a resume. Keep a few things about yourself secret and elusive. When you decide on a picture of yourself, pick something funny, like a digitally edited picture of you

---

with devil horns, or a funny picture of yourself. Demonstrating FUN is the biggest priority when your picture is the first thing women see when they look at your profile. Have a list of qualities and attributes you like in women. Have a list of disqualifiers that you don't like in women as well. Keep your disqualifiers pretty short; you only need to communicate that you are selective and picky. A list called, "Things I find attractive in women" will make EVERY woman read through your list to see if they qualify.

On the intro to your page, let everyone know that you are basically only looking for friends because there are so many weird and psycho girls on the Internet and it makes you very cautious about meeting them online.

As they look through your profile, women will screen keywords as they read to see if you have what they are looking for. Make sure you talk about how great your own life is and how much you enjoy it. This is incredibly attractive to women. As you write your paragraph about yourself, put a few things in there to demonstrate personality. Use humor and don't try to make it sound professional. Here are a few samples to go by:1. "I am 26 and my life has never been better! Every day is more fun than the next and I love being me. I am only looking for friends here because the Internet has waaaaay too many psychotic and weird girls. If you know how to shop, and you aren't a basket case, drop me a line."
2. "Women beware! I am a bachelor and I'm probably not the right guy for you. If you aren't adventurous and fun, there are PLENTY of boring guys on here. If you are emotionally mature, a good friend, and know how to be a bitch when you need to be, you rock."
3. "I'm not the right guy for you if you like boring, ass-kissing guys. I am responsible, but I live above the common level of life. Nothing is more fun than being me and I love my life."
4. "Things I find attractive in women: Emotional maturity, FUN, ability to exchange cocky banter, being a good friend, women who have and keep good friends, women who can be a bitch if they need to, playfulness, confidence, not being a stalker, having goals, the ability to have fun no matter what you are doing, and conversation skills."
5. "Things I will never tolerate inwomen: neediness, insecurity, stalker potential, immaturity (although it's awesome to have tons of fun), inability to keep friends in your life, having no goals, and dating loser guys for no reason."
6. "Please don't write me if you like dating ass-kissing, ap-proval-seeking men. I am mostly on here for friends due to the increasingly large volume of women who are boring on here. If you are fun, adventurous, mature, and describe yourself as a 'good friend,' send me a note. There are millions of boring-guy profiles on here who will buy you tons of stuff if that's what you are looking for. I want someone to have FUN with. We can talk about other stuff later. PLEASE DON'T WRITE ME IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PUPPY DOG."
7. "Nothing is more important to me right now than my life. I have fun no matter what I'm doing and I love being me. I'd like to eventually share that with someone and make them important too, but I'm just looking for friends on here right now. Lots of women on here are kinda creepy, so I am just looking for women who like to have fun and aren't a basket case. No, I won't giveyou my cell number unless I get to know you. I judge women by the quality of friends they have. I think this is a huge indicator of maturity and womanhood that most don't have today."
8. "Things I like to do: Have FUN no matter what, play stupid games at bars that embarrass my friends, kayaking, rock climbing, giving high-fives to random people on the street, keeping my friends out of trouble, watching my dog stare at himself in the mirror, leaving my cell phone at home for a day, surfing, bonfires on the beach, staying in when it's raining (yeah, it's girly, but I love it), going to guitar stores and playing random guitars, messing with employees at drive-throughs, dog parks, mentoring friends, and making fun of girls who can dish it back out."

# THE 17-DAY 

TRANSFORMATION PROCESS

This program has been used by all kinds of men with all kinds of problems with women. It has worked almost completely and it was made to work for you. You only have to be READY for the switch to being an Alpha Male. It is a lifestyle change that doesn't just change who you are while you are approaching women. It's permanent and it's your choice.

Buy an organizer or a pocket calendar to help you document your progress. You will be able to mark the day you began to feel the change. And if you are unable to finish an assignment, you can push it to the right and finish itlater. Remember, this is not a science, so feel free to make mistakes and laugh your ass off about it. This program is to be used day-byday, making small, but significant movement in the right direction. Use it at your own pace. It's your personal coach, but you have to be committed to becoming the AMG. The actual shift in lifestyle takes place in different places within the program for different guys, but you will know it as soon as you feel it. The exercises and homework assignments each day are designed to effect a change in your life. Some are designed for social muscle development, while others are for attraction-building skills.

## DAY 1

Take care of yourself. You should be in a better mood than anyone around you. All you have to do today is smile. Smile like you are having the best day of your life and everything always goes your way. When someone is in a really good mood, people can tell and it is extremely attractive. People know by your smile that you don't have anything to prove, nor do you have any hatred for anyone you meet. It's irresistible and you will notice a different reaction today when you act like you're hav-ing the best day of your life.

## DAY 2

You will say "hey" to ten people you don't know. Smile because of your own happiness, not to let people know you're not mad. They can be men or women. It doesn't matter. Just be happy. No one can resist sharing happiness with someone, even if they are a stranger. It's magnetic.

## DAY 3

Don't dress up today. Be casual. Don't shave or even do anything to your hair. Wear pajamas, old gym shorts and a plain old t-shirt, some old sweats, or whatever you want.

If this is what you wear every single day, start getting a wardrobe that doesn't scream you still live with your parents. Enough said.

## DAY 4

Make a list of what you want in a woman. List specifically what you will not tolerate and what you find unattractive.

## DAY 5

The malls are full of kiosks with pushy, overselling salesmen. Go out today, act like you are to-tally interested in a few products, look them over for a few minutes, and walk away. Tell the salesman you aren't interested. Salesmen put all kinds of social pressure on you to stay there and keep talking and looking at products. Tolerance to social pressure will put you ahead of ninety percent of men. You NEED to be able to tolerate pressure and completely brush it off. This ability alone will make you stand out to women.

## DAY 6

Make a list of what you want to eliminate from your life and post it on your bathroom mirror or a conspicuous place.

## DAY 7

Today you will compliment ten people, men or women, on something unusual like shoes, watch etc. Remember that complimenting women is NOT a way to pick them up.

## DAY 8

Write all the habits down you need to start doing in your life. Keep it with you and look at it often. Be hard on yourself when it comes to improving.

## DAY 9

Concentrate on body language fora day. Write down the body language notes from the earlier chapter and keep it with you. Make constant reference to it.

## DAY 10

Concentrate on tonality for a day. Wear earplugs at home so you can hear you vocal tone and improve on it. Read a few pages of this book aloud and find your natural male voice. It's in there.

## DAY 11

Buy three women's magazines and one popular romance novel and read them. Insight and knowledge are key to this. Understanding how women think will help you when you reverse the mating pursuit roles. After reading this book, articles and stories designed for women will mean something COMPLETELY different to you. Try it.

## DAY 12

Ask three store employees (men or women) for good movie recommendations.

## DAY 13

Practice eye contact for a day. Smile while you do this and it will never be seen as a threat. When you are speaking to someone, maintain eye contact and keep their attention.## DAY 14

Call at least three company's toll-free numbers and use approach questions and story routines on the female operators.

## DAY 15

Carry something completely ridiculous around to the bar/club tonight. (A roll of yarn, a teddy bear, a hard hat, a framed photo of your grandmother, etc.)

## DAY 16

Go to Starbucks or a coffee shop near your house and read a romance novel in front of everyone.

# RELATIONSHIPS 

0nce you become a successful AMG, you'll have the awesome privilege of having fantastic physical and emotional relationships with the women you always wanted. Throughout your relationships, you will inevitably hit some speed bumps, roadblocks, and a few detours. Illustrated are two major scales in relationships with women. Once one side is weighted the other will rise. Here is the crash course on the most important and crucial things for you to remember in a relationship.

Also, you will learn the basic principles of how to argue, fight (metaphorically speaking), keep romance and desire alive, and hold your own when she gets pissed off about something. The art of manliness is one of constant awareness and vigilance. You must keep theclosest watch on your own emotions and feelings. They can ruin a good day quickly.

The beginning of a relationship is the phase where both of you put in a lot of work, not to keep the relationship going, but to make sure your partner sees you as a cool guy or girl. Both of you are self-conscious, slightly reserved, and very observant.

The beginning of a sexual relationship does not mean your AMG behaviors take a break. They continue into the relationship and will be the most flammable liquid when it comes to keeping the "fire" going.

## GIFTS

Buying gifts should be on a random and unpredictable timetable. Unless it's a huge holiday, don't overwhelm her. Bring home a gift for no reason whatsoever. Write a letter to her and hide it where she'll find it later. Send flowers once every three months or so for no reason at all.

She will appreciate anything you do for her tenfold if you do it irregularly and infrequently.

## DEALING WITH HER BITCHING

When she vents, even if it's about you, you have to remember two things about this:1. She is NOT expressing a set of new and permanent viewpoints about you. They will change eventually and she WILL get out of her mood.
2. She only needs you to listen when she's mad at you. She's not secretly asking for you to explain yourself.
The urge to try to "fix" her mood and lift her out of being depressed or pissed off is almost uncontrollable. But you must resist it.

When she starts to complain about her day, her friends, her life or even you, you must LISTEN.

You have to resist the urges to talk her out of her mood. Resist the urge to defend yourself. While she is mad at you, nothing can change her mind except talking about it. As she talks, it's as if she's taking baby steps out of a hole in the ground. She will talk herself out of her own bad moods most of the time if you are a good listener. Wait a day or two to defend yourself. Oftentimes, she WILL apologize for what she said if you are a good listener.

Make sure she feels like you are protecting her and you want her to feel safe. ALWAYS take her side when she's pissed off about something other than you.## JEALOUSY AND INSECURITY

You will feel it at all kinds of weird and inexplicable times. Some guys feel it if she has guy friends who call her a lot. Some men feel it when she goes to the bar or club without them. It happens to the best of us. It's happened to me.

You MUST deal with this however you can. Eliminate jealousy and insecurity from your life. Banish it forever. These are the top two reasons that women lose attraction for men.

It gets so bad with some guys that they will go through her cell phone, start checking her email, look through her drawers, or even have her followed. This is a natural instinct designed to prevent a woman from cheating on you. Fifty thousand years ago, if a woman cheated on you and you didn't know, you might wind up raising some other dude's baby and never know it. So jealousy and insecurity played a part long ago, but not today. The AMG displays total aloofness to this and if she tries to test him, he only laughs it off as if she were joking.

Some women will need to know you get a LITTLE bit jealous at times in order to know you really care for them. This is okay, but don't overdo it.

---

Don't EVER put down her guy friends or any other man in front of her. If you put down another man in front of a woman, it only communicates one thing: He is a threat to you. Don't do it.

KEEPING HER HANGING ON
Women say they stay with men for all kinds of reasons, but there are two biological and three emotional reasons she will stay with you:

Biological Reasons:

1. He is able and willing to provide for our potential offspring and me.
2. He is able and willing to protect our potential offspring and me.

Emotional Reasons:

1. He is fun and makes me feel good about myself.
2. He is responsible and always takes the lead.
3. He makes me feel sexy and treats me like a princess.

When a woman selects a man for a long-term relationship, she is looking for a man with the same qualities she wants in an ideal father figure:

1. Takes care of her
2. Treats her with respect3. Will call her BS if need be
4. Willing to risk himself to defend her
5. Committed to her through whatever happens
6. Takes the lead and doesn't back down
7. More responsible than her
8. His responsibility allows her to relax and let him "drive"
9. Always tells her he loves her
10. He is her HERO
11. Has honor and insists that she have the same
12. Teaches her things
13. He is willing to forgive her if she's made an error
14. He's a lion against the world, but a total softie for her
15. He's mature, responsible, and willing to admit his mistakes
16. Sets an example for her to follow on how to live life
17. He is something she wants to be like
18. HE IS SOMEONE SHE WOULD WANT HER DAUGHTER TO MARRY

When a man has these qualities, a woman feels as though she can fully trust him with her body and her mind. She has no reason to doubt him, and he will never willingly hurt her or abandon her. These are all traits of the "ideal father."

---

If she starts withholding sex, losing attraction, treating you bad, or taking the lead, she is either testing you, or you can trace back the cause to something you did to communicate low status or insecurity. Women are very simple to maintain and need only the slightest amount of maintenance. I don't care if you think you have a high-maintenance woman, she's not. With the right man, who knows his role in the relationship as a man, she can relax and be a natural woman.

# TROUBLESHOOTING APPROACH PROBLEMS 

While most of your problems within an interaction can be traced back to one of the 55 Laws, I'm going to cover some frequently experienced problems here and how to fix them.

1. Getting bad body language from women on the approach

Getting bad body langage means one of two things: Either you are facing in to the group too much or are coming off as somewhat needy. Work on this and you will find your weakness
2. Getting fake numbers

Girls do this for several reasons: Either she has a boyfriend and doesn't want to hurt your feelings, she's married but lives to be flirted with and just used you to boost her egoor you demonstrated too much physical interest in her in the initial interaction. When you first approach, try not to make faces like you think the lines coming out of your mouth are the coolest thing she's going to hear this year. Keep a very calm and controlled appearance and don't let her cach you sneaking a peak at cleavage, ass or anything else. Remember to be selective and that she has not yet earned your affection.
3. Too nervous on the approach

Simply put; everyone gets this and you will need to approach several women in all kinds of situations to get over it. The quickest ad fastest way to get over the anxiety of approaching is to use absolutely ridiculous lines with the intent for her to reject you and see how much you can get away with. Have your friends make up lame-ass lines for you to go and use designed for you to fail. It will be fun and make sure you take pictures to remember your times as an average guy. It won't be long before you are at the round table.
4. Not getting called back after you leave a voice mail

This goes along the same lines as getting fake numbers. Girls

---

use men to boost their egos and usually never plan on getting back with them. When a woman gets a creepy voicemail, or even worse, when you call her seven hundred times because she doesn't answer, you wont get a call back.

If you haven't successfully made it into the 'TWO' phase, then she will likely think you are only calling her for a one nighter or because of her physical appearance. You have not shown her that you are interested in her beyond that. Keep the sequence in your head when you go out.
