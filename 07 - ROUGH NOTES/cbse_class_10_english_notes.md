### A Tiger in the Zoo
Poet: Leslie Norris
Book: First Flight
Type: Poetry

---

#### Central Idea / Theme
The poem contrasts the life of a tiger in a **zoo** with its life in the **wild**. It highlights the **agony and helplessness** of a wild animal caged for human entertainment.

---

#### Stanza-Wise Explanation

The tiger walks quietly in his cage with his bright stripes. He takes only a few steps because the cage is small. He is angry but quiet ("quiet rage") because he is helpless.

**Stanza 3:**
In the wild, he would be snarling around houses at the jungle's edge, showing his white fangs and claws, terrorizing the village.

**Stanza 4:**
But in reality, he is locked in a concrete cell. His strength is confined behind bars. He ignores the visitors who come to see him.

The poet uses **wit and irony** to describe the characteristics of animals like the Lion, Tiger, Leopard, Bear, Hyena, Crocodile, and Chameleon. The underlying theme is the danger associated with these beasts, presented in a light-hearted manner.

---

#### Stanza-Wise Explanation

**Stanza 1 (Asian Lion):** If you see a large, tawny beast in the East that roars so loudly you die of fear, it is the Asian Lion.
**Stanza 2 (Bengal Tiger):** If a noble beast with black stripes on a yellow ground eats you, it is the Bengal Tiger.
**Stanza 3 (Leopard):** If a beast with spots leaps on you repeatedly, it is a Leopard. Roaring with pain won't help; he will only leap again.
**Stanza 4 (Bear):** If a creature hugs you very hard, it is a Bear. If you are unsure, he will give you another hug (kill you by crushing).
**Stanza 5 (Hyena & Crocodile):** Hyenas smile while eating their prey, while Crocodiles weep (shed tears).
**Stanza 6 (Chameleon):** A small lizard-like creature with no ears or wings. If there is nothing on the tree, 'tis the Chameleon (because of camouflage).

- **Alliteration:** "**R**oaming **r**ound", "**L**ep and **l**ep again", "**W**ho **w**eeps".

---

#### Stanza-Wise Explanation

**Stanza 1:**
The poet sees a boy who has lost his ball. The ball bounced down the street and fell into the water. The boy is very upset.

**Stanza 2:**
The poet says there is no use telling the boy "there are other balls" because his grief is deep. The boy stands rigid and trembling, staring into the harbor where his ball went. The ball represents his childhood memories, which are now gone forever.

**Stanza 3:**
The poet decides not to intrude or offer money (a dime) for a new ball because it is worthless in this moment. The boy is learning his first lesson of responsibility in a world where people will lose things ("balls will be lost always").

The boy is learning the "epistemology of loss"—how to stand up against misery and survive. This is a lesson every man must learn.

---

The poem symbolically describes the **movement of trees** from inside a house to the forest outside. It represents the **conflict between man and nature**.

The trees inside the house are moving out into the forest. The forest has been empty for days, with no birds, insects, or sun. The poet says the forest will be full of trees by morning.

The roots work all night to separate themselves from the veranda floor. The leaves strain towards the glass, and small twigs become stiff with exertion. Long branches shuffle under the roof like patients discharged from a hospital—dazed but moving towards freedom.

**Stanza 3:**
The poet sits inside writing letters but doesn't mention the departure of the forest. The night is fresh, the moon is shining, and the smell of leaves and lichen reaches her like a voice.

### For Anne Gregory
Poet: William Butler Yeats
Book: First Flight
Type: Poetry

---

#### Central Idea / Theme
The poem is a conversation between the poet and a young woman named Anne Gregory. It explores the nature of **love** and **beauty**. The poet argues that men love women for their physical beauty (like golden hair) and not for their inner self. Anne wants to be loved for "herself alone," but the poet concludes that only God can love a person purely for who they are, irrespective of their outer appearance.

---

#### Stanza-Wise Explanation

**Stanza 1:**
The poet tells Anne that no young man can ignore her beautiful "honey-coloured" hair and love her for herself alone. Her outer beauty is a barrier ("ramparts") that prevents men from looking deeper.

**Stanza 2:**
Anne replies that she can dye her hair brown, black, or carrot color. She hopes that by changing her appearance, men will love her for her inner self and not just her yellow hair.

**Stanza 3:**
The poet counters that he heard an old religious man say that only God has the ability to love a person for "themselves alone" and not for their physical attributes (yellow hair). Human love is inherently tied to physical attraction.

---

#### Literary Devices / Figures of Speech
- **Metaphor:** "Ramparts at your ear" (hair compared to defensive walls of a fort).
- **Alliteration:** "**H**oney-coloured", "**Y**our **y**ellow", "**L**ove **y**ou".

---

#### Important Lines & Their Meanings
- **"Ramparts at your ear"**: Her hair is like a wall that protects/hides her true self but also traps men's attention.
- **"Love me for myself alone"**: The universal desire to be loved for one's character, not looks.
- **"Only God, my dear, / Could love you for yourself alone"**: A realistic/cynical view that human love is superficial; only divine love is unconditional.
